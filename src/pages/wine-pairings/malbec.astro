  <h2>Understanding Malbec</h2>

  <p>## Tasting Notes

A thorough evaluation considers appearance, aromatics, palate impression, and finish. Each element contributes to the overall quality assessment.

## How We Rate

Our scoring reflects multiple factors:

| **Value** | 25% | Price-to-quality ratio |
| **Typicity** | 20% | True to variety/region |
| **Drinkability** | 15% | Immediate enjoyment |
