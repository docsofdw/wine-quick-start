  After years of experimenting with wine with <a href="/wine-pairings/best-wine-with-salmon" class="internal-link">seafood</a>, certain principles emerge that transform how you think about wine and food together.

  <h2>Why Muscadet Works Best with Seafood</h2>

  <p>Muscadet is our sommelier team's top recommendation for seafood. The wine's bright acidity cleanses the palate between bites, while its citrus and mineral notes enhance seafood's natural flavors.</p>

  <h2>Top 3 Wine Styles for Seafood</h2>

  <h3>1. Muscadet (Top Pick)</h3>

  <p>Crisp and refreshing, Muscadet offers the perfect counterpoint to seafood's delicate textures.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>**Flavor Profile**: Citrus, stone fruit, mineral finish</li>
    <li>**Why It Works**: Acidity brightens and cleanses</li>
    <li>**Price Range**: $15-40</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>2. Albariño (Versatile Choice)</h3>

  <p>Albariño offers a more elegant, nuanced option that pairs beautifully with a variety of seafood preparations.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>**Flavor Profile**: Floral notes, balanced acidity, clean finish</li>
    <li>**Why It Works**: Versatile enough for simple or complex dishes</li>
    <li>**Price Range**: $12-30</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>3. Verdicchio (Budget-Friendly)</h3>

  <p>Don't overlook Verdicchio as an excellent value option for everyday seafood dishes.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>**Flavor Profile**: Light, crisp, refreshing</li>
    <li>**Why It Works**: Great quality-to-price ratio</li>
    <li>**Price Range**: $10-20</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Pairing Tips from Our Sommeliers</h2>

  <h3>Consider the Preparation</h3>

  <p>How your seafood is prepared matters as much as the seafood itself:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>**Grilled or Roasted**: Go bolder with oaked whites</li>
    <li>**Light or Poached**: Choose unoaked, crisp whites</li>
    <li>**With Rich Sauce**: Match the sauce's intensity with your wine choice</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Temperature Matters</h3>

  <p>Chill white wines to 45-50°F for optimal refreshment, but not so cold that the flavors are muted.</p>

  <h2>Wines to Avoid with Seafood</h2>

  <p>Not every wine works with seafood. Here's what to skip:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>**Heavy oaked wines**: Can clash with lighter preparations</li>
    <li>**Very sweet wines**: Unless you're pairing with a sweet glaze or sauce</li>
    <li>**Full-bodied reds**: Usually too heavy for the dish</li>
  </ul>
