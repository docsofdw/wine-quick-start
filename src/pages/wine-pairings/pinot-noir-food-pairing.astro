<ModernPairingLayout frontmatter={frontmatter}>
  <div slot="quick-answer">
    <p><strong>Best foods for Pinot Noir:</strong> Duck, salmon, mushroom dishes, roasted chicken, and aged cheeses. Pinot Noir's moderate tannins and bright acidity make it incredibly food-friendly. Avoid very spicy foods or heavy red meat dishes.</p>
  </div>

  <h2>Why Pinot Noir is Perfect for Food</h2>
  
  <p>Pinot Noir is considered the ultimate food wine because of its unique characteristics:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Moderate tannins</strong> that won't overpower delicate flavors</li>
    <li><strong>Bright acidity</strong> that cleanses the palate and cuts through rich foods</li>
    <li><strong>Medium body</strong> that bridges light and heavy dishes</li>
    <li><strong>Complex aromatics</strong> that complement rather than compete with food</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Classic Pinot Noir Pairings</h2>

  <h3>Duck (The Perfect Match)</h3>
  <p>Duck and Pinot Noir is one of gastronomy's greatest partnerships:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Duck's rich fat is balanced by Pinot's acidity</li>
    <li>Earthy flavors in both wine and duck complement each other</li>
    <li>Works with duck breast, confit, or roasted whole duck</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Salmon & Fish</h3>
  <p>One of the few reds that pairs beautifully with fish:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Light tannins won't clash with delicate fish flavors</li>
    <li>Particularly excellent with grilled or cedar plank salmon</li>
    <li>Also works with tuna, trout, and meaty fish preparations</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Mushroom Dishes</h3>
  <p>Pinot Noir's earthy character makes it ideal for mushrooms:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Wild mushroom risotto becomes transcendent</li>
    <li>Mushroom pasta, soups, and tarts all work beautifully</li>
    <li>The wine's earthiness echoes mushroom terroir</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Regional Pairing Styles</h2>

  <h3>Burgundy (France)</h3>
  <p>Elegant and refined, perfect for:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Coq au vin and classic French preparations</li>
    <li>Aged soft cheeses like Brie and Camembert</li>
    <li>Roasted chicken with herbs</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Oregon Pinot Noir</h3>
  <p>Fruit-forward and food-friendly, excellent with:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Pacific Northwest salmon and seafood</li>
    <li>Roasted pork tenderloin</li>
    <li>Vegetarian dishes and roasted vegetables</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>California Pinot Noir</h3>
  <p>Richer and more powerful, pairs well with:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Grilled lamb chops</li>
    <li>BBQ with fruit-based sauces</li>
    <li>Stronger flavored dishes</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Cheese Pairing Guide</h2>

  <p>Pinot Noir works beautifully with cheese:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Soft-ripened:</strong> Brie, Camembert, triple cream cheeses</li>
    <li><strong>Semi-hard:</strong> Gruyère, aged cheddar, Comté</li>
    <li><strong>Goat cheese:</strong> Fresh chèvre, aged goat cheeses</li>
    <li><strong>Avoid:</strong> Very strong blue cheeses (too overpowering)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Cooking Methods That Work</h2>

  <ol>
    <li><strong>Roasting:</strong> Brings out complementary earthy flavors</li>
    <li><strong>Grilling:</strong> Adds smokiness that pairs with wine's complexity</li>
    <li><strong>Braising:</strong> Creates rich, wine-friendly sauces</li>
    <li><strong>Sautéing:</strong> Quick cooking preserves delicate flavors</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Foods to Avoid</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>❌ Very spicy dishes (overwhelm the wine's subtlety)</li>
    <li>❌ Heavy red meat steaks (too rich, need bigger wines)</li>
    <li>❌ Overly sweet preparations (clash with wine's dry character)</li>
    <li>❌ Very salty or heavily cured meats (compete with wine)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Seasonal Pairing Ideas</h2>

  <p><strong>Spring:</strong> Lamb with herbs, fresh salmon, asparagus dishes</p>
  <p><strong>Summer:</strong> Grilled salmon, duck salad, tomato-based dishes</p>
  <p><strong>Fall:</strong> Wild mushroom dishes, roasted duck, game birds</p>
  <p><strong>Winter:</strong> Braised short ribs, coq au vin, aged cheeses</p>

  <p>The beauty of Pinot Noir lies in its versatility. As the saying goes, "Burgundy makes you think of silly things, Bordeaux makes you talk about them, and Champagne makes you do them." Start with these classics and let your palate guide you to new discoveries.</p>
