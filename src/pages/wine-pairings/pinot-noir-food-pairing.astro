  <div slot="quick-answer">
    <p><strong>Quick Answer:</strong> Pinot Noir pairs exceptionally with duck, salmon, mushrooms, and soft cheeses. Its light tannins, bright acidity, and earthy complexity make it the most food-friendly red wine.</p>
  </div>

  <h2>Why Pinot Noir is the Perfect Food Wine</h2>
  
  <p>Pinot Noir stands apart from other red wines due to its unique characteristics:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Light tannins</strong> that don't overpower delicate dishes</li>
    <li><strong>Bright acidity</strong> that cleanses the palate</li>
    <li><strong>Medium body</strong> that bridges light and heavy foods</li>
    <li><strong>Earthy complexity</strong> that complements both meat and vegetables</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Perfect Pinot Noir Pairings</h2>

  <h3>Duck - The Classic Match</h3>
  <p>The quintessential Pinot Noir pairing:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Duck's rich, gamey flavor matches Pinot's earthy notes</li>
    <li>Wine's acidity cuts through duck's fat</li>
    <li>Both have medium intensity that complement each other</li>
    <li>Traditional in Burgundy for centuries</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Salmon - Red Wine with Fish</h3>
  <p>One of the few red wines that works with fish:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Salmon's meaty texture can handle light red wine</li>
    <li>Pinot's delicate tannins won't overpower the fish</li>
    <li>Especially good with grilled or cedar plank salmon</li>
    <li>Oregon Pinot Noir with Pacific salmon is magical</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Mushrooms - Earthy Perfection</h3>
  <p>A natural partnership:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Both wine and mushrooms share earthy, forest floor notes</li>
    <li>Pinot's umami qualities enhance mushroom dishes</li>
    <li>Perfect with mushroom risotto, pizza, or pasta</li>
    <li>Wild mushrooms especially complement aged Burgundy</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Roasted Chicken & Turkey</h3>
  <p>Poultry's best friend:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Light enough not to overpower white meat</li>
    <li>Rich enough to complement dark meat</li>
    <li>Herbs and spices in poultry echo wine's complexity</li>
    <li>Excellent with both casual and holiday preparations</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Cheese Pairings</h2>

  <h3>Soft, Creamy Cheeses</h3>
  <p><strong>Perfect matches:</strong> Brie, Camembert, triple-cream cheeses</p>
  <p>Pinot's acidity cuts through rich, creamy textures while complementing earthy rinds.</p>

  <h3>Medium-Aged Cheeses</h3>
  <p><strong>Great options:</strong> Gruyère, aged Gouda, Comté</p>
  <p>Nutty, complex flavors in aged cheeses mirror Pinot's sophistication.</p>

  <h3>Goat Cheese</h3>
  <p>Fresh or aged goat cheese works beautifully:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Tangy cheese balances wine's fruit</li>
    <li>Especially good with herb-crusted goat cheese</li>
    <li>Try with warm goat cheese salads</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Vegetarian Pinot Noir Pairings</h2>

  <h3>Mushroom Dishes</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Mushroom risotto with aged Parmesan</li>
    <li>Wild mushroom pizza with truffle oil</li>
    <li>Portobello mushroom "steaks"</li>
    <li>Mushroom and herb pasta</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Root Vegetables</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Roasted beets with goat cheese</li>
    <li>Caramelized carrots and parsnips</li>
    <li>Sweet potato dishes</li>
    <li>Roasted vegetable medleys</li>
  </ul>

    <li><strong>Glassware:</strong> Use Burgundy glasses to concentrate aromatics</li>

  <p>Pinot Noir's versatility makes it the ultimate food wine. Its balance of fruit, earth, and acidity allows it to complement rather than compete with food.

  <h2>Expert Tips</h2>
<ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-4 text-gray-700">
  <li><strong>Match Pinot Noir's Weight to Food Intensity</strong> - Oregon Pinot Noir's silky tannins and bright acidity make it perfect for salmon and duck, while Burgundy's earthier, more mineral-driven profile pairs beautifully with mushroom risotto or coq au vin. Avoid overpowering delicate Pinot with heavy sauces—instead, let its natural fruit and earth notes complement rather than compete with your dish.</li>

  <li><strong>Serve at 60-65°F for Optimal Food Pairing</strong> - Pinot Noir shows its best food-pairing qualities when served slightly cooler than room temperature. At this temperature, the wine's natural acidity remains vibrant enough to cut through rich foods like duck confit, while the fruit flavors don't become overly jammy and mask subtle flavors in dishes like herb-crusted lamb.</li>

  <li><strong>Choose Young Pinot for Protein, Aged for Earthy Dishes</strong> - Young Pinot Noir (2-5 years) retains bright cherry and raspberry notes that complement grilled salmon or roasted chicken beautifully. Aged Pinot (8+ years) develops complex forest floor, leather, and truffle notes that create magical pairings with wild mushrooms, game birds, and aged cheeses like Époisses or Camembert.</li>

  <li><strong>Decant Only Aged Burgundy and High-End Producers</strong> - Most Pinot Noir doesn't need decanting due to its naturally soft tannins, but aged Burgundy (10+ years) or premium California Pinot from producers like Williams Selyem benefit from 30-45 minutes of air exposure before serving with food. This allows tertiary flavors to emerge that complement complex dishes like beef bourguignon.</li>

  <li><strong>Use Burgundy Glasses to Enhance Aromatics for Food</strong> - Pinot Noir's food-pairing success relies heavily on its aromatic complexity. A proper Burgundy glass with its wide bowl concentrates the wine's delicate red fruit, floral, and earthy aromas, allowing them to integrate seamlessly with the aromatics of dishes like roasted pork tenderloin with herbs de Provence.</li>

  <li><strong>Consider Regional Terroir for Specific Cuisines</strong> - Russian River Valley Pinot Noir's fog-influenced freshness pairs exceptionally with Pacific Northwest cuisine like cedar-plank salmon, while Côte de Nuits' limestone-driven minerality complements French cuisine's butter and cream-based sauces. Central Otago's spicier profile works beautifully with game meats and aromatic spices.</li>

  <li><strong>Match Acidity Levels to Fat Content</strong> - Pinot Noir's naturally high acidity (typically 6.0-6.5 g/L) makes it exceptional for cutting through rich, fatty foods. Pair high-acid Pinot from cool climates like Sonoma Coast with duck breast or pork belly, while lower-acid examples from warmer regions work better with leaner proteins like grilled tuna or roasted turkey.</li>

  <li><strong>Time Your Pairing with Food Temperature</strong> - Serve Pinot Noir with warm dishes immediately after opening to allow the wine's temperature to gradually rise with the meal. This creates an evolving pairing experience—starting with bright fruit notes that complement appetizers, then developing into earthier flavors that enhance main courses like mushroom-stuffed chicken or beef tenderloin with truffle sauce.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<div class="space-y-6">
  <div>
    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-wine-700 mb-2">What foods should you avoid pairing with Pinot Noir?</h3>
    <p class="text-gray-700">Avoid pairing Pinot Noir with heavily spiced dishes, coconut-based curries, or very oily fish like mackerel, as these can overwhelm the wine's delicate fruit character. The wine's moderate tannins and bright acidity also clash with overly sweet desserts or dishes with excessive heat from chili peppers. Instead, opt for subtly seasoned preparations that complement rather than compete with Pinot Noir's elegant profile.</p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-wine-700 mb-2">Does the region of Pinot Noir affect food pairing choices?</h3>
    <p class="text-gray-700">Absolutely - Burgundian Pinot Noir's earthy minerality pairs beautifully with mushroom dishes and coq au vin, while fruit-forward California Pinot Noir complements grilled salmon and herb-crusted lamb. Oregon Pinot Noir, with its balanced acidity and spice notes, works exceptionally well with duck confit and wild game. The terroir-driven characteristics of each region create distinct pairing opportunities that should guide your food selections.</p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-wine-700 mb-2">Why is Pinot Noir considered the best red wine for salmon?</h3>
    <p class="text-gray-700">Pinot Noir's lighter body and bright acidity complement salmon's rich, oily texture without overpowering its delicate flavor, while the wine's red fruit notes enhance the fish's natural sweetness. Unlike heavier reds with dominant tannins, Pinot Noir's silky texture creates a harmonious bridge between red wine richness and seafood elegance. The wine's earthy undertones also pair beautifully with salmon's umami characteristics, especially when the fish is grilled or cedar-plank prepared.</p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-wine-700 mb-2">What's the difference between pairing young vs aged Pinot Noir with food?</h3>
    <p class="text-gray-700">Young Pinot Noir (2-5 years) showcases bright cherry and raspberry flavors that pair excellently with lighter dishes like roasted chicken, grilled vegetables, or fresh herb preparations. Aged Pinot Noir (8+ years) develops complex secondary flavors of forest floor, leather, and dried fruits that complement richer preparations like braised short ribs, wild mushroom risotto, or aged cheeses. The evolution from primary fruit to tertiary complexity requires adjusting your food choices to match the wine's flavor development.</p>

  <div>
    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-wine-700 mb-2">Should you serve Pinot Noir at room temperature for food pairing?</h3>
    <p class="text-gray-700">Serve Pinot Noir slightly below room temperature at 60-65°F (15-18°C) for optimal food pairing results, as this temperature preserves the wine's delicate aromatics while maintaining its fresh acidity. Overly warm Pinot Noir becomes flabby and loses the bright acidity essential for cutting through rich foods like duck or creamy sauces. A 20-30 minute refrigeration before serving ensures the wine's elegant structure complements rather than competes with your meal.</p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-wine-700 mb-2">Is Pinot Noir good for pairing with vegetarian dishes?</h3>
    <p class="text-gray-700">Pinot Noir excels with vegetarian cuisine due to its moderate tannins and bright acidity that won't overpower plant-based flavors, while its earthy undertones complement mushroom-based dishes perfectly. The wine pairs beautifully with roasted root vegetables, eggplant parmesan, and lentil-based preparations where its red fruit character adds complexity without domination. Avoid pairing with raw or very delicate vegetables, as even Pinot Noir's gentle nature can overwhelm subtle flavors.</p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-wine-700 mb-2">What's the biggest mistake people make when pairing Pinot Noir with food?</h3>
    <p class="text-gray-700">The most common mistake is treating all Pinot Noirs the same - a powerful Russian River Pinot Noir requires different food pairings than a delicate Sancerre Rouge or ethereal Volnay. Many people also over-season dishes, masking the wine's subtle nuances with heavy sauces or excessive spices. Understanding your specific bottle's weight, tannin level, and flavor profile is crucial for successful pairing rather than following generic "Pinot Noir rules."</p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-wine-700 mb-2">Can you pair Pinot Noir with spicy food?</h3>
    <p class="text-gray-700">Pinot Noir can handle mild to moderate spice levels, particularly dishes with warm spices like cinnamon, allspice, or mild chili rather than fiery heat that would clash with the wine's delicate profile. The wine's fruit-forward character and refreshing acidity can actually complement dishes with gentle heat, such as lightly spiced lamb tagine or mild Indian preparations. However, avoid extremely spicy foods that would overwhelm Pinot Noir's subtle complexity and render its elegant flavors undetectable.</p>
