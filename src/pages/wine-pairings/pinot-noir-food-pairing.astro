  <p><strong>Quick Answer:</strong> Pinot Noir pairs exceptionally with duck, salmon, mushrooms, and soft cheeses. Its light tannins, bright acidity, and earthy complexity make it the most food-friendly red wine.</p>

  <h2>Why Pinot Noir is the Perfect Food Wine</h2>
  
  <p>Pinot Noir stands apart from other red wines due to its unique characteristics:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Light tannins</strong> that don't overpower delicate dishes</li>
    <li><strong>Bright acidity</strong> that cleanses the palate</li>
    <li><strong>Medium body</strong> that bridges light and heavy foods</li>
    <li><strong>Earthy complexity</strong> that complements both meat and vegetables</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Perfect Pinot Noir Pairings</h2>

  <h3>Duck - The Classic Match</h3>
  <p>The quintessential Pinot Noir pairing:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Duck's rich, gamey flavor matches Pinot's earthy notes</li>
    <li>Wine's acidity cuts through duck's fat</li>
    <li>Both have medium intensity that complement each other</li>
    <li>Traditional in Burgundy for centuries</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Salmon - Red Wine with Fish</h3>
  <p>One of the few red wines that works with fish:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Salmon's meaty texture can handle light red wine</li>
    <li>Pinot's delicate tannins won't overpower the fish</li>
    <li>Especially good with grilled or cedar plank salmon</li>
    <li>Oregon Pinot Noir with Pacific salmon is magical</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Mushrooms - Earthy Perfection</h3>
  <p>A natural partnership:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Both wine and mushrooms share earthy, forest floor notes</li>
    <li>Pinot's umami qualities enhance mushroom dishes</li>
    <li>Perfect with mushroom risotto, pizza, or pasta</li>
    <li>Wild mushrooms especially complement aged Burgundy</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Roasted Chicken & Turkey</h3>
  <p>Poultry's best friend:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Light enough not to overpower white meat</li>
    <li>Rich enough to complement dark meat</li>
    <li>Herbs and spices in poultry echo wine's complexity</li>
    <li>Excellent with both casual and holiday preparations</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Cheese Pairings</h2>

  <h3>Soft, Creamy Cheeses</h3>
  <p><strong>Perfect matches:</strong> Brie, Camembert, triple-cream cheeses</p>
  <p>Pinot's acidity cuts through rich, creamy textures while complementing earthy rinds.</p>

  <h3>Medium-Aged Cheeses</h3>
  <p><strong>Great options:</strong> Gruyère, aged Gouda, Comté</p>
  <p>Nutty, complex flavors in aged cheeses mirror Pinot's sophistication.</p>

  <p>Fresh or aged goat cheese works beautifully:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Tangy cheese balances wine's fruit</li>
    <li>Especially good with herb-crusted goat cheese</li>
    <li>Try with warm goat cheese salads</li>
  </ul>

  </ul>
