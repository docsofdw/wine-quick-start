  <p><strong>Quick Answer:</strong> Start with basic principles - match intensity, consider dominant flavors, and balance acidity. White wines pair with lighter dishes, reds with heartier fare, but exceptions make wine pairing interesting.</p>

  <h2>Wine Pairing Fundamentals</h2>

  <p>Wine pairing is both art and science, combining traditional knowledge with personal preference to create harmonious dining experiences.</p>

  <h2>The BAT Framework</h2>

  <h3>Body</h3>
  <p>Match the weight of the wine to the weight of the dish. Light wines with delicate foods, full-bodied wines with rich, heavy dishes.</p>

  <h3>Acidity</h3>
  <p>High-acid wines cut through rich, fatty foods and cleanse the palate. Essential for cream sauces and buttery dishes.</p>

  <h3>Tannins</h3>
  <p>Tannins in red wines interact with proteins and fats, softening over the course of a meal with the right dishes.</p>

  <h2>Classic Pairing Principles</h2>

  <h3>Complement</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Match similar flavors and intensities</li>
    <li>Light wines with delicate dishes</li>
    <li>Bold wines with robust flavors</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Contrast</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Use opposite characteristics for balance</li>
    <li>Sweet wines with spicy food</li>
    <li>High-acid wines with rich dishes</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Food Categories & Wine Matches</h2>

  <h3>Seafood</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>**Delicate fish**: Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio</li>
    <li>**Rich fish (salmon)**: Chardonnay, light Pinot Noir</li>
    <li>**Shellfish**: Champagne, Albariño</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Poultry</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>**Chicken**: Chardonnay, light reds</li>
    <li>**Duck**: Pinot Noir, Côtes du Rhône</li>
    <li>**Turkey**: Beaujolais, medium-bodied whites</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Red Meat</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>**Beef**: Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec</li>
    <li>**Lamb**: Syrah, Bordeaux blends</li>
    <li>**Pork**: Pinot Noir, Riesling</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Cheese Pairing Guide</h2>

  <h3>Fresh Cheeses</h3>
  <p>**Mozzarella, Ricotta**: Light whites like Pinot Grigio or Soave</p>

  <h3>Soft-Ripened</h3>
  <p>**Brie, Camembert**: Champagne or light reds like Beaujolais</p>

  <h3>Hard Cheeses</h3>
  <p>**Aged Cheddar, Parmesan**: Bold reds like Cabernet or Barolo</p>

  <h3>Blue Cheeses</h3>
  <p>**Roquefort, Stilton**: Sweet wines like Port or Sauternes</p>

  <h2>Regional Pairing Wisdom</h2>

  <p>"What grows together, goes together" - this old adage holds true. Italian wines with Italian food, French wines with French cuisine, etc.</p>

  <h3>Italian Combinations</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Chianti with tomato-based pasta</li>
    <li>Pinot Grigio with seafood risotto</li>
    <li>Barolo with aged Parmesan</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>French Classics</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Chablis with oysters</li>
    <li>Burgundy with coq au vin</li>
    <li>Sauternes with foie gras</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Common Pairing Mistakes</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>**Overpowering delicate dishes** with bold wines</li>
    <li>**Ignoring sauce flavors** - often more important than the protein</li>
    <li>**Serving temperature issues** - affects how wine tastes with food</li>
    <li>**Not considering cooking method** - grilled vs. poached changes everything</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Advanced Techniques</h2>

  <h3>Bridge Ingredients</h3>
  <p>Use herbs, spices, and sauces that echo wine characteristics. Rosemary with earthy reds, citrus with crisp whites.</p>

  <h3>Seasonal Considerations</h3>
  <p>Light, fresh wines in summer; rich, warming wines in winter. Let the season guide your choices.</p>

  <h3>Multiple Course Planning</h3>
  <p>Progress from light to heavy, dry to sweet. Plan the wine journey alongside the meal progression.</p>

  <h2>Building Your Pairing Confidence</h2>

  <p>Start with classic combinations, then experiment. Keep notes on what works. Trust your palate - personal preference trumps rules.</p>

  <h3>Practice Exercises</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Try the same wine with different cheeses</li>
    <li>Taste wine before and after food</li>
    <li>Compare how cooking method affects pairing</li>
  </ul>
