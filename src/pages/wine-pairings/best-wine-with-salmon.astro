<ModernPairingLayout frontmatter={frontmatter}>
  <div slot="quick-answer">
    <p><strong>Best wines for salmon:</strong> Albariño, Pinot Noir, Chablis, or off-dry Riesling. Choose whites for delicate preparations and light reds for richer, grilled salmon. The key is matching wine weight to cooking method and sauce intensity.</p>
  </div>

  <h2>Why Salmon is Wine-Friendly</h2>
  
  <p>Salmon's unique characteristics make it one of the most versatile fish for wine pairing:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Rich texture</strong> that can handle both white and light red wines</li>
    <li><strong>Natural oils</strong> that need wine acidity to cleanse the palate</li>
    <li><strong>Mild flavor</strong> that won't overpower delicate wines</li>
    <li><strong>Versatile preparation methods</strong> that pair with different wine styles</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>White Wine Pairings</h2>

  <h3>Albariño (Our Top Pick for Grilled)</h3>
  <p>This Spanish coastal wine is magical with salmon:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>High acidity cuts through salmon's rich oils</li>
    <li>Mineral notes complement the fish's natural flavors</li>
    <li>Sea spray character echoes salmon's oceanic origins</li>
    <li>Perfect for grilled or blackened salmon</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Chablis & Unoaked Chardonnay</h3>
  <p>Classic French elegance meets Pacific salmon:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Steely minerality doesn't compete with fish</li>
    <li>Crisp acidity provides perfect palate cleansing</li>
    <li>Ideal for poached salmon or cream-based sauces</li>
    <li>Burgundian terroir adds sophistication</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Riesling (For Spiced Preparations)</h3>
  <p>German precision for complex salmon dishes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Off-dry sweetness balances spicy Asian marinades</li>
    <li>High acidity cuts through rich teriyaki glazes</li>
    <li>Stone fruit notes complement fruit salsas</li>
    <li>Works beautifully with cedar plank smoking</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Red Wine Pairings</h2>

  <h3>Pinot Noir (The Perfect Red)</h3>
  <p>The only red wine many sommeliers recommend with fish:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Light tannins won't overpower delicate salmon</li>
    <li>Bright acidity complements fish oils</li>
    <li>Earthy notes work with herb crusts</li>
    <li>Exceptional with grilled or cedar plank salmon</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Beaujolais (Light & Fresh)</h3>
  <p>Gamay's bright fruit pairs surprisingly well:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Low tannins preserve fish's delicate texture</li>
    <li>Berry notes complement fruit-based sauces</li>
    <li>Serve slightly chilled for best results</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Pairing by Preparation Method</h2>

  <h3>Grilled or Blackened Salmon</h3>
  <p><strong>Best wines:</strong> Albariño, Pinot Noir, or Sancerre</p>
  <p>The char and smokiness can handle more assertive wines with good acidity.</p>

  <h3>Poached or Steamed Salmon</h3>
  <p><strong>Best wines:</strong> Chablis, Muscadet, or light Burgundy</p>
  <p>Delicate preparation needs gentle, mineral-driven wines.</p>

  <h3>Cedar Plank Salmon</h3>
  <p><strong>Best wines:</strong> Oregon Pinot Noir or aged white Burgundy</p>
  <p>Smoky cedar notes pair beautifully with earthy wines.</p>

  <h3>Smoked Salmon</h3>
  <p><strong>Best wines:</strong> Champagne, Crémant, or crisp Riesling</p>
  <p>Bubbles and high acidity cut through rich, smoky flavors.</p>

  <h3>Teriyaki or Asian-Style</h3>
  <p><strong>Best wines:</strong> Off-dry Riesling, Gewürztraminer, or Viognier</p>
  <p>Sweet-salty glazes need wines with balancing sweetness.</p>

  <h2>Sauce & Seasoning Considerations</h2>

  <h3>Cream-Based Sauces</h3>
  <p>Rich sauces need wines with good acidity:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Chablis or white Burgundy</li>
    <li>Sancerre or Pouilly-Fumé</li>
    <li>Avoid low-acid wines that will taste flat</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Herb Crusts (Dill, Parsley, Thyme)</h3>
  <p>Herbal notes pair with:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Sauvignon Blanc from Loire Valley</li>
    <li>Pinot Noir with earthy characteristics</li>
    <li>Vermentino or other herb-friendly whites</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Citrus Preparations</h3>
  <p>Lemon, lime, or orange need:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>High-acid wines to match citrus brightness</li>
    <li>Albariño, Verdejo, or Vinho Verde</li>
    <li>Avoid oaky wines that clash with citrus</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Regional Wine Traditions</h2>

  <p><strong>Pacific Northwest:</strong> Oregon Pinot Noir with local salmon</p>
  <p><strong>France:</strong> Loire Valley whites (Sancerre, Muscadet) with salmon</p>
  <p><strong>Spain:</strong> Rías Baixas Albariño with grilled preparations</p>
  <p><strong>Germany:</strong> Mosel Riesling with smoked or spiced salmon</p>

  <h2>Pro Tips for Perfect Pairing</h2>

  <ol>
    <li><strong>Match intensity:</strong> Delicate poached salmon needs light wines</li>
    <li><strong>Consider the sauce:</strong> Often more important than the fish itself</li>
    <li><strong>Temperature matters:</strong> Serve whites well-chilled, reds slightly cool</li>
    <li><strong>Don't overthink it:</strong> Salmon is very wine-friendly</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Wines to Avoid</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>❌ Heavy, oaky Chardonnays (overpower the fish)</li>
    <li>❌ Tannic red wines (clash with delicate flavors)</li>
    <li>❌ Very sweet wines (unless with spicy preparations)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Remember, the best pairing is the one you enjoy. These guidelines provide a starting point, but personal preference always wins. Whether you prefer the classic elegance of Chablis or the coastal charm of Albariño, salmon's versatility ensures a delicious match.</p>
