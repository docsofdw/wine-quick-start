  Mastering wine with pizza transforms how you experience both wine and food. Here's your comprehensive guide.

  <h2>Why Chianti Works Best with Pizza</h2>

  <p>Chianti is our sommelier team's top recommendation for pizza. The wine's structured tannins cut through the richness of pizza, while its dark fruit flavors create a harmonious balance on the palate.</p>

  <h2>Top 3 Wine Styles for Pizza</h2>

  <h3>1. Chianti (Top Pick)</h3>

  <p>Bold and full-bodied, Chianti brings intensity that stands up to pizza's robust flavors.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>**Flavor Profile**: Dark fruits, spice, structured tannins</li>
    <li>**Why It Works**: Tannins cut through fat and protein</li>
    <li>**Price Range**: $15-40</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>2. Montepulciano (Versatile Choice)</h3>

  <p>Montepulciano offers a more approachable, fruit-forward option that pairs beautifully with a variety of pizza preparations.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>**Flavor Profile**: Red fruits, soft tannins, smooth finish</li>
    <li>**Why It Works**: Versatile enough for simple or complex dishes</li>
    <li>**Price Range**: $12-30</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>3. Lambrusco (Budget-Friendly)</h3>

  <p>Don't overlook Lambrusco as an excellent value option for everyday pizza dishes.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>**Flavor Profile**: Earthy, medium-bodied, food-friendly</li>
    <li>**Why It Works**: Great quality-to-price ratio</li>
    <li>**Price Range**: $10-20</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Pairing Tips from Our Sommeliers</h2>

  <h3>Consider the Preparation</h3>

  <p>How your pizza is prepared matters as much as the pizza itself:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>**Grilled or Roasted**: Go bolder with full-bodied reds</li>
    <li>**Light or Poached**: Choose lighter reds like Pinot Noir</li>
    <li>**With Rich Sauce**: Match the sauce's intensity with your wine choice</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Temperature Matters</h3>

  <p>Serve red wines slightly below room temperature (60-65°F) to let the flavors shine without the alcohol dominating.</p>

  <h2>Wines to Avoid with Pizza</h2>

  <p>Not every wine works with pizza. Here's what to skip:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>**Very tannic young wines**: Can overpower delicate flavors</li>
    <li>**Very sweet wines**: Unless you're pairing with a sweet glaze or sauce</li>
    <li>**Light-bodied whites**: Generally lack the weight to match</li>
  </ul>
