  <p><strong>Quick Answer:</strong> Nebbiolo, aged white Burgundy, or Barbera. These wines complement mushroom risotto's earthy, creamy profile without overpowering delicate mushroom flavors. For a budget option, try a crisp Vouvray.</p>

  <h2>Why These Wines Work</h2>
  
  <p>Mushroom risotto presents a unique pairing challenge. The dish combines:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Earthy umami</strong> from mushrooms (porcini, shiitake, or mixed wild)</li>
    <li><strong>Rich creaminess</strong> from butter, cheese, and starchy rice</li>
    <li><strong>Subtle flavors</strong> that can be easily overwhelmed</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The ideal wine needs enough body to match the richness, sufficient acidity to cut through the cream, and complementary earthy or mineral notes.</p>

  <h2>Red Wine Pairings</h2>

  <h3>Nebbiolo (Our Top Pick)</h3>
  <p>Piedmont's noble grape is the perfect match for mushroom risotto. Its signature characteristics include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>High acidity that refreshes the palate</li>
    <li>Earthy, truffle-like aromas that echo mushroom flavors</li>
    <li>Fine tannins that won't clash with the creamy texture</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Barbera</h3>
  <p>Another Piedmontese favorite, Barbera offers:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Bright cherry fruit to lift the earthy flavors</li>
    <li>Naturally high acidity with minimal tannins</li>
    <li>Great value compared to Nebbiolo</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>White Wine Pairings</h2>

  <h3>White Burgundy (Chardonnay)</h3>
  <p>A well-aged Burgundy brings:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Creamy texture that mirrors the risotto</li>
    <li>Nutty, buttery notes from oak aging</li>
    <li>Enough weight to stand up to the rich dish</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Vouvray Sec</h3>
  <p>Loire Valley Chenin Blanc provides:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Crisp acidity to cleanse the palate</li>
    <li>Honeyed notes that complement earthy mushrooms</li>
    <li>Versatility with different mushroom varieties</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Pro Tips for Perfect Pairing</h2>

  <ol>
    <li><strong>Temperature matters:</strong> Serve reds slightly cool (60-65°F) and whites well-chilled (45-50°F)</li>
    <li><strong>Consider the mushrooms:</strong> Delicate mushrooms pair better with whites, while porcini can handle bigger reds</li>
    <li><strong>Match the sauce:</strong> Cream-based risottos need higher acidity wines</li>
    <li><strong>Don't overpower:</strong> Avoid heavily oaked or tannic wines that mask subtle flavors</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Budget-Friendly Alternatives</h2>

  <p>Great pairings don't have to break the bank:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Dolcetto d'Alba</strong> ($15-20): Light, fruity Piedmont red</li>
    <li><strong>Grüner Veltliner</strong> ($12-18): Austrian white with herbal notes</li>
    <li><strong>Côtes du Rhône Blanc</strong> ($10-15): Affordable French blend</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Common Mistakes to Avoid</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>❌ Heavy, tannic reds like Cabernet Sauvignon overwhelm the dish</li>
    <li>❌ Light, fruity wines like Pinot Grigio lack sufficient body</li>
    <li>❌ Sweet wines clash with the savory umami flavors</li>
  </ul>
