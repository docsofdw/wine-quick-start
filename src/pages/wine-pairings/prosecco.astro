<h2>Origins & History</h2>

<p>Prosecco's journey from obscure Italian grape to global sparkling sensation represents one of wine's most remarkable transformation stories. The variety, known as <strong>Glera</strong> until 2009, traces its roots to the steep hillsides of Valdobbiadene and Conegliano in Italy's Veneto region, where it has been cultivated since at least the 1600s.</p>

<p>The name "Prosecco" derives from the village of Prosecco (now Prosek) near Trieste, where Roman poet Ausonius praised the local wine in the 4th century. However, recent DNA analysis has revealed fascinating genetic connections—Glera shares parentage with several indigenous Balkan varieties, suggesting ancient migration patterns across the Adriatic that predate written records.</p>

<h3>From Local Curiosity to International Phenomenon</h3>

<p>For centuries, Prosecco remained a regional specialty, traditionally made as a <strong>frizzante</strong> (lightly sparkling) wine using ancestral methods. The pivotal moment came in 1876 when Antonio Carpenè founded the first Italian sparkling wine school in Conegliano, introducing Charmat method production that would define modern Prosecco's fresh, fruit-forward character.</p>

<p>The variety's reputation received crucial elevation in 2009 when Italy implemented strict geographical protections, redesignating the grape as Glera while reserving "Prosecco" exclusively for wines from designated DOCG and DOC zones. This legal framework transformed Prosecco from a grape name into a protected designation, similar to Champagne's geographic exclusivity.</p>

<h3>Global Expansion and Modern Trends</h3>

<p>Today, while authentic Prosecco remains confined to specific Italian regions, Glera plantings have expanded globally. <strong>Australia's King Valley</strong>, Argentina's high-altitude vineyards, and California's coastal regions now cultivate the variety, though these wines cannot legally use the Prosecco name. Current global Glera plantings exceed 25,000 hectares, with Italian production alone reaching over 500 million bottles annually—making it the world's most consumed sparkling wine category, surpassing even Champagne in volume since 2013.</p>

<h2>Grape Characteristics & Winemaking</h2>

<h3>Viticulture: The Foundation of Quality Prosecco</h3>

<p>Glera, the primary grape behind Prosecco, thrives in the cool, hillside vineyards of Veneto and Friuli-Venezia Giulia. This vigorous variety requires careful canopy management to prevent overcropping, as excessive yields dilute the delicate floral aromatics that define quality Prosecco. The best producers limit yields to 13.5 tons per hectare in Prosecco DOCG zones, significantly below Glera's natural potential of 20+ tons per hectare.</p>

<p>Harvest timing proves critical for achieving the grape's signature balance of crisp acidity and subtle fruit character. Early October picking preserves the bright malic acid levels (typically 7-9 g/L) essential for maintaining freshness in the final sparkling wine. The steep, south-facing slopes of Valdobbiadene and Conegliano provide ideal drainage and sun exposure, allowing Glera to develop concentrated flavors while retaining its characteristic mineral backbone derived from the region's calcareous soils.</p>

<h3>Winemaking: The Charmat Method Advantage</h3>

<p>Prosecco's distinctive character emerges through the <strong>Charmat method</strong> (metodo italiano), where secondary fermentation occurs in pressurized stainless steel tanks rather than individual bottles. This technique preserves Glera's delicate primary fruit aromatics—white peach, green apple, and acacia blossom—that would be overwhelmed by the toasty, brioche notes developed through traditional Champagne-method production.</p>

<p>Temperature-controlled fermentation between 64-68°F maintains the grape's volatile aromatic compounds, particularly the terpenes responsible for Prosecco's floral bouquet. Most producers avoid malolactic fermentation entirely, preserving the wine's signature bright acidity and preventing the buttery characteristics that would mask Glera's subtle fruit profile. Stainless steel aging for 3-4 months on fine lees adds textural complexity without compromising the wine's fresh, immediate appeal.</p>

<h3>Regional Expression and Quality Indicators</h3>

<p>Prosecco di Conegliano-Valdobbiadene DOCG represents the pinnacle of quality, where steep hillside vineyards and mineral-rich soils produce wines with greater concentration and complexity. These premium bottlings display pronounced stone fruit character with distinctive saline minerality. In contrast, Prosecco DOC from the broader Veneto plains tends toward lighter, more approachable styles emphasizing citrus and green apple notes.</p>

<p><strong>Rive</strong> designations indicate single-vineyard sites within the DOCG zone, typically showing enhanced mineral expression and longer finish. Quality indicators include persistent, fine bubbles, clear varietal character without excessive sweetness, and balanced acidity around 6.5-7.5 g/L.</p>

<h3>Evolution and Aging Potential</h3>

<p>Unlike Champagne, Prosecco is crafted for immediate consumption, typically reaching peak expression within 1-2 years of release. The wine's fresh fruit character gradually fades, while its signature effervescence diminishes over time. However, the finest Valdobbiadene examples can maintain their elegance for 3-4 years when properly stored at 55°F, developing subtle honeyed notes while retaining their essential vibrancy.</p>

<h2>What Does Prosecco Taste Like?</h2>

<h3 class="text-wine-700">Appearance and Visual Cues</h3>
<p>Quality Prosecco displays a pale straw to light golden hue, with the finest examples showing brilliant clarity and persistent, fine bubbles that form elegant streams—what sommeliers call "perlage." The mousse (foam) should be creamy white and dissipate slowly. Deeper golden tones often indicate extended lees contact in premium bottlings like Prosecco Superiore DOCG, while overly yellow hues may suggest oxidation or excessive age in standard Prosecco DOC.</p>

<h3 class="text-wine-700">Aromatic Profile</h3>
<p>Primary aromas showcase Glera's signature freshness: crisp green apple, Williams pear, and white peach dominate, often accompanied by delicate white flowers like acacia and elderflower. Secondary fermentation notes contribute subtle bread crust and brioche qualities in tank-fermented examples, while the rare bottle-fermented Proseccos develop more complex yeasty, almond-like autolytic character. Tertiary aromas in aged expressions include honey, dried fruits, and mineral undertones reflecting the hillside limestone soils of Valdobbiadene and Conegliano.</p>

<h3 class="text-wine-700">Palate and Structure</h3>
<p>Prosecco typically presents light to medium body with vibrant acidity (6.5-7.5 pH) that provides the essential backbone for sparkling wines. The alcohol impression ranges from 11-12.5% ABV, feeling fresh rather than warming. Texture varies dramatically by style: <strong>Brut</strong> offers crisp, clean minerality; <strong>Extra Dry</strong> (counterintuitively sweeter) provides rounder mouthfeel; while <strong>Dry</strong> delivers noticeable sweetness balancing the natural acidity.</p>

<h3 class="text-wine-700">Flavor Characteristics</h3>
<p>The palate mirrors the aromatic intensity with pronounced stone fruit flavors—particularly ripe pear and peach—alongside citrus zest notes of lemon and grapefruit. Premium examples from steep hillside vineyards display distinctive mineral salinity and subtle herbal hints of sage and thyme. Tank fermentation preserves primary fruit purity, while rare traditional method versions develop toasty, nutty complexity.</p>

<h3 class="text-wine-700">Finish and Quality Markers</h3>
<p>High-quality Prosecco delivers a medium-length finish with persistent fruit flavors and cleansing acidity that invites the next sip. Premium indicators include: fine, persistent bubbles lasting 30+ seconds; balanced residual sugar integration; distinct terroir expression; and aromatic complexity beyond simple fruit. Avoid bottles with coarse bubbles, cloying sweetness, or harsh astringency—hallmarks of inferior production methods or excessive yields.</p>

<h2>Origins & History</h2>

<p>Prosecco's remarkable journey from a humble northeastern Italian grape to a global sparkling wine phenomenon spans centuries of winemaking evolution. The variety's story begins with <strong>Glera</strong>, the grape's official name since 2009, which has thrived in the Veneto and Friuli regions for over a millennium.</p>

<h3>Ancient Roots and Geographic Origins</h3>

<p>Historical records trace Glera cultivation back to Roman times, when the grape flourished in the hills surrounding modern-day Conegliano and Valdobbiadene. The name "Prosecco" itself derives from the village of Prosecco near Trieste, where this aromatic variety was first documented in the 16th century. Italian ampelographers have confirmed through DNA analysis that Glera is indigenous to northeastern Italy, with genetic markers linking it specifically to the steep, mineral-rich soils of the Treviso province.</p>

<h3>The Charmat Method Revolution</h3>

<p>While Prosecco existed as a still wine for centuries, its transformation into the sparkling wine we know today occurred in the early 1900s. <strong>Federico Martinotti's invention of the tank fermentation method</strong> in 1895, later refined by Eugène Charmat, revolutionized Prosecco production. This technique preserved the grape's delicate floral aromatics—notes of green apple, white peach, and acacia blossom—that would be lost in traditional bottle fermentation.</p>

<h3>Modern Recognition and Global Expansion</h3>

<p>Prosecco's international breakthrough came in the 1960s when Italian producers began marketing it as an elegant, approachable alternative to Champagne. The establishment of <strong>DOCG status for Conegliano Valdobbiadene in 2009</strong> marked a pivotal moment, protecting the most prestigious production zones while distinguishing quality levels.</p>

<p>Today, Prosecco production has expanded beyond Italy's borders, with notable plantings in Australia's King Valley, Brazil's Serra Gaúcha, and Argentina's high-altitude regions. However, <strong>over 90% of global Prosecco still originates from Italy</strong>, where approximately 25,000 hectares of Glera vines produce more than 600 million bottles annually, making it one of the world's most successful sparkling wine categories.</p>

<h2>Grape Characteristics & Winemaking</h2>

<p>Glera, the primary grape behind Prosecco, is a vigorous, high-yielding variety that thrives in the cool, hillside vineyards of Veneto and Friuli-Venezia Giulia. This naturally productive grape requires careful canopy management to maintain quality, with yields legally capped at 13.5 tons per hectare in DOCG zones and 18 tons in DOC areas. The grape's thin skins and tight clusters make it susceptible to botrytis, demanding meticulous vineyard timing and selective harvesting, typically occurring in early to mid-September when acids remain crisp and sugars reach 9.5-10.5% potential alcohol.</p>

<h3 class="text-wine-700">Fermentation Philosophy</h3>

<p>Prosecco's signature freshness stems from the <strong>Charmat method</strong> (Metodo Martinotti), where secondary fermentation occurs in temperature-controlled stainless steel tanks rather than individual bottles. This technique preserves Glera's delicate floral aromatics—particularly white flowers, green apple, and citrus zest—while maintaining the grape's characteristic minerality. Primary fermentation typically occurs at 16-18°C over 15-20 days, followed by secondary fermentation at 12-14°C for 30-40 days. Malolactic fermentation is deliberately avoided to preserve the wine's vibrant acidity, which ranges from 6-7 g/L tartaric acid equivalent.</p>

<h3 class="text-wine-700">Regional Expression</h3>

<p>Glera's terroir sensitivity becomes evident across Prosecco's hierarchy. In the prestigious <strong>Conegliano Valdobbiadene DOCG</strong>, steep slopes with calcareous-clay soils and significant diurnal temperature variation produce wines with intense minerality, complex white fruit flavors, and remarkable longevity. The subzone of Cartizze, with its unique microclimate and ancient marine sediments, yields Proseccos of extraordinary finesse and concentration. In contrast, the broader Prosecco DOC encompasses flatter vineyard sites that produce approachable, fruit-forward wines with softer acidity and broader appeal.</p>

<h3 class="text-wine-700">Quality Markers</h3>

<p>Superior Proseccos exhibit several telltale characteristics: a persistent, fine mousse with pinpoint bubbles indicating proper secondary fermentation; aromatic complexity beyond simple fruit, including honey, almond blossom, and subtle herb notes; and a long, mineral-driven finish that reflects true terroir expression. The best examples show <strong>textural depth</strong> from extended lees contact and demonstrate the grape's ability to balance richness with refreshing acidity.</p>

<h3 class="text-wine-700">Evolution and Aging</h3>

<p>While designed for immediate consumption, quality Proseccos can evolve beautifully for 2-4 years. Base wines from top producers develop honeyed complexity, toasted bread notes, and deeper fruit concentration while maintaining their essential vivacity. Vintage-dated Proseccos from exceptional years, particularly from Conegliano Valdobbiadene's premier sites, can age gracefully for up to six years, developing nuanced tertiary aromas that showcase Glera's surprising aging potential.</p>

<h2>What Does Prosecco Taste Like?</h2>

<h3>Appearance: Visual Clues to Quality</h3>
<p>Quality Prosecco displays a <strong>pale straw to light gold color</strong>, with the deepest hues typically found in DOCG expressions from Valdobbiadene and Conegliano. The wine should show brilliant clarity with persistent, fine bubbles forming a steady mousse—a visual indicator of proper secondary fermentation. <strong>Coarser, larger bubbles suggest lower quality</strong> or improper handling, while the finest Proseccos exhibit what Italians call "perlage fine," tiny bubbles that rise in elegant chains.</p>

<h3>Aromatics: From Orchard to Glass</h3>
<p>Prosecco's aromatic profile centers on <strong>primary fruit aromatics</strong> that showcase the Glera grape's inherent freshness. Expect vibrant notes of green apple, pear, and white peach, often accompanied by citrus zest—particularly lemon and grapefruit. <strong>Secondary fermentation aromas</strong> contribute subtle bread crust and brioche notes in premium examples, while floral elements like acacia blossom and wisteria add complexity.</p>

<p>Superior Proseccos from hillside vineyards often display <strong>mineral undertones</strong>—limestone and wet stone characteristics derived from the calcareous soils of the Prosecco DOCG zone. These tertiary aromatics distinguish exceptional bottles from everyday expressions.</p>

<h3>Palate: Texture and Structure</h3>
<p>Prosecco typically presents a <strong>light to medium body</strong> with vibrant acidity that creates a refreshing, mouth-watering sensation. The carbonation should feel creamy rather than aggressive, with fine bubbles that enhance rather than overwhelm the fruit flavors. Alcohol levels usually range from 11-12%, providing a subtle warming sensation without heaviness.</p>

<h3>Flavor Profile: The Glera Expression</h3>
<p>On the palate, expect a continuation of the aromatic profile: <strong>crisp green apple and ripe pear dominate</strong>, supported by citrus notes that provide brightness and lift. Premium examples often show subtle almond and honey nuances, while the finest DOCG Proseccos reveal delicate mineral salinity that speaks to their unique terroir.</p>

<h3>Finish and Quality Markers</h3>
<p>Quality Prosecco delivers a <strong>clean, refreshing finish</strong> with lingering fruit and a subtle mineral note. Superior examples maintain their flavor intensity through a medium-length finish, while basic Proseccos tend to fade quickly.</p>

<p><strong>Premium quality indicators include</strong>: persistent fine bubbles, complex aromatics beyond simple fruit, noticeable minerality, and a finish that invites the next sip rather than leaving the palate feeling stripped or overly dry.</p>

  <h2>Expert Tips</h2>
<ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-4 text-gray-700">
  <li><strong>Decode the Quality Pyramid Through DOCG vs DOC Classifications</strong> - Prosecco di Conegliano e Valdobbiadene DOCG represents the apex, with stricter yield limits (13.5 tons/hectare vs 18 for DOC) and hand-harvesting requirements that create more concentrated flavors. These bottles typically show greater complexity with notes of white peach and acacia honey, while standard DOC Prosecco offers bright apple and citrus character. The DOCG versions age better and justify their 40-60% price premium through superior terroir expression.</li>

  <li><strong>Match Sweetness Levels to Your Occasion and Food Pairings</strong> - Brut Nature (0-3g/L residual sugar) pairs brilliantly with raw oysters and crudo, while Extra Dry (12-17g/L) - despite its name being sweeter than Brut - complements spicy Asian cuisine and fruit-based desserts. The higher sugar content in Extra Dry actually helps balance heat and enhances the wine's fruit-forward character, making it more versatile than many assume.</li>

  <li><strong>Serve Prosecco at 42-46°F for Optimal Bubble Expression</strong> - Unlike Champagne which can handle slightly warmer temperatures, Prosecco's Charmat method bubbles are larger and more delicate. Serving too cold (below 40°F) masks the fruit aromatics, while too warm (above 50°F) causes rapid CO2 loss. Use an ice bucket for 15-20 minutes rather than over-chilling in the refrigerator, which can mute the characteristic pear and green apple notes.</li>

  <li><strong>Choose Your Glass Shape Based on Prosecco Style</strong> - Flutes work well for basic DOC Prosecco to concentrate the bubbles and aromatics, but superior DOCG bottles deserve white wine glasses with a wider bowl. The increased surface area allows the more complex terroir-driven flavors to develop, particularly the mineral notes from the limestone-rich soils of Conegliano and Valdobbiadene. Avoid coupe glasses which dissipate the essential effervescence too quickly.</li>

  <li><strong>Never Decant Prosecco - But Master the Opening Technique</strong> - Prosecco's charm lies in its fresh, immediate bubble structure created by the Charmat method. Decanting destroys this completely. Instead, chill the bottle neck down at a 45-degree angle, remove the foil and cage slowly while maintaining pressure on the cork, then twist the bottle (not the cork) for a gentle "sigh" opening. This preserves maximum CO2 and prevents the loss of delicate floral aromatics.</li>

  <li><strong>Consume Within 18-24 Months for Peak Quality</strong> - Unlike traditional method sparkling wines, Prosecco doesn't benefit from extended aging due to its tank fermentation process. The fresh fruit character and bright acidity that define quality Prosecco begin to fade after two years. Check the disgorgement date when available, or look for clear, bright appearance and avoid bottles with sediment, which indicates the wine is past its prime.</li>

  <li><strong>Identify Superior Prosecco Through Visual and Aromatic Cues</strong> - Premium Prosecco displays persistent, fine bubbles that rise in continuous chains rather than large, rapidly dissipating bubbles found in lower-quality options. The mousse should be creamy rather than aggressive. Aromatically, look for distinct white flower notes (acacia, elderflower) alongside fruit - generic "fruity" scents often indicate industrial production methods rather than careful vineyard selection.</li>

  <li><strong>Time Your Consumption to the Season and Style</strong> - Lighter DOC Prosecco shines as an aperitif during warm months when its crisp acidity and bright bubbles provide refreshment. Reserve premium DOCG bottles for cooler weather or special occasions when you can appreciate their greater complexity and food-pairing potential. The higher concentration and mineral complexity of hill-grown grapes from Cartizze or Rive designations deserves contemplative drinking rather than casual sipping.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Aging & Cellaring</h2>

<p>Unlike many still wines, <strong>prosecco is crafted for immediate enjoyment</strong>, with aging potential varying dramatically across quality levels. Understanding these differences is crucial for maximizing your investment in different prosecco styles.</p>

<h3>Aging Potential by Quality Level</h3>

<p><strong>Prosecco DOC</strong> should be consumed within 18-24 months of purchase, as the Glera grape's delicate floral aromatics fade quickly. <strong>Prosecco DOCG Conegliano Valdobbiadene</strong> offers more structure, aging gracefully for 3-5 years, developing honeyed notes and increased minerality from the steep hillside vineyards' calcareous soils.</p>

<p><strong>Cartizze DOCG</strong>, prosecco's most prestigious designation, can evolve beautifully for 5-8 years, gaining complexity as primary peach and apple flavors integrate with subtle yeast autolysis characteristics. Vintage proseccos, particularly from exceptional producers like Bisol or Nino Franco, may improve for up to a decade.</p>

<h3>Storage Requirements</h3>

<p>Store prosecco bottles <strong>horizontally at 50-55°F (10-13°C)</strong> with 70% humidity. Unlike Champagne, prosecco's tank fermentation method produces less protective lees contact, making proper storage critical to prevent premature oxidation.</p>

<h3>Evolution and Peak Windows</h3>

<p>Quality prosecco evolves from bright citrus and white flower notes toward <strong>richer stone fruit and mineral complexity</strong>. The finest examples develop subtle brioche notes from extended lees contact during secondary fermentation.</p>

<p><strong>Drink Prosecco DOC within 2 years</strong>, Prosecco DOCG at 2-4 years, and reserve Cartizze for special occasions within 5-7 years of vintage.</p>

<h3>Aging vs Spoilage Signs</h3>

<p>Proper aging brings <strong>integrated bubbles, deeper golden color, and enhanced minerality</strong>. Spoilage appears as flat bubbles, browning beyond pale gold, or vinegar-like acetaldehyde aromas. Trust your palate—fresh prosecco should always maintain vibrant acidity and clean fruit expression.</p>

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<div class="space-y-6">
  <div>
    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-wine-700 mb-2">What's the difference between Prosecco DOCG and DOC quality levels?</h3>
    <p class="text-gray-700">Prosecco DOCG represents the highest quality tier, produced exclusively in the historic Conegliano-Valdobbiadene and Asolo zones using stricter regulations and lower yields. DOC Prosecco covers a much larger area across nine provinces and allows higher production volumes, resulting in generally lighter, more accessible wines. DOCG bottles typically cost $18-40 while DOC versions range from $8-20, with DOCG offering more complexity and aging potential.</p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-wine-700 mb-2">How do Brut, Extra Dry, and Dry Prosecco styles compare in sweetness?</h3>
    <p class="text-gray-700">Despite the confusing names, Extra Dry Prosecco (12-17g/L residual sugar) is actually sweeter than Brut (0-12g/L), while Dry is the sweetest at 17-32g/L residual sugar. Brut offers the crispest, most food-friendly profile with prominent citrus and green apple notes. Extra Dry provides a rounder mouthfeel with subtle fruit sweetness that appeals to casual drinkers, while Dry works best as an aperitif or with spicy Asian cuisine.</p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-wine-700 mb-2">Is premium Prosecco worth the extra cost compared to budget options?</h3>
    <p class="text-gray-700">Premium Proseccos ($20+) from top producers like Bisol, Nino Franco, or Adami offer significantly more complexity, finer bubbles, and better integration between fruit and acidity than mass-market bottles under $12. The difference lies in vineyard location, lower yields, longer lees contact, and more careful grape selection. For special occasions or serious wine appreciation, the upgrade is worthwhile, but budget options work perfectly fine for casual drinking or mixing in cocktails.</p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibeled text-wine-700 mb-2">What are the main alternatives if I want something similar to Prosecco but different?</h3>
    <p class="text-gray-700">Cava from Spain offers similar freshness and bubbles at comparable prices but with more mineral complexity and longer aging on lees. French Crémant provides elegance closer to Champagne style while remaining affordable, particularly Crémant de Loire or Crémant de Limoux. For a unique twist, try Lambrusco from Emilia-Romagna for a fruitier, food-friendly sparkling red, or German Sekt for crisp, aromatic bubbles with pronounced acidity.</p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-wine-700 mb-2">How long should I keep Prosecco before drinking, and does aging improve it?</h3>
    <p class="text-gray-700">Most Prosecco is designed for immediate consumption and doesn't improve with extended aging - the fresh, vibrant character that defines good Prosecco actually diminishes over time. Drink standard DOC Prosecco within 1-2 years of purchase, while premium DOCG versions can hold for 2-3 years if stored properly in cool, dark conditions. Unlike Champagne, Prosecco's Charmat method preserves primary fruit flavors rather than developing complex secondary characteristics through aging.</p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-wine-700 mb-2">What's the biggest mistake people make when choosing Prosecco?</h3>
    <p class="text-gray-700">The most common error is buying Prosecco too far in advance or storing opened bottles incorrectly, leading to flat, oxidized wine that misrepresents the category entirely. Many people also choose based solely on price without considering the occasion - splurging on premium DOCG for casual brunches or buying basic DOC for anniversary celebrations. Understanding the quality pyramid and matching the wine to its intended use ensures better value and enjoyment across all price points.</p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-wine-700 mb-2">Should I choose Prosecco based on the producer or the region?</h3>
    <p class="text-gray-700">Focus on region first, then producer - the Conegliano-Valdobbiadene DOCG zone consistently produces superior wines due to its steep hillside vineyards and ideal microclimate, regardless of producer. Within each region, established producers like Villa Sandi, Carpené Malvolti, or Zardetto offer reliable quality and consistency. However, don't overlook smaller growers in premium zones, as they often provide exceptional value and unique expressions of their specific vineyard sites.</p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-wine-700 mb-2">How do I serve different styles of Prosecco to maximize their potential?</h3>
    <p class="text-gray-700">Serve all Prosecco styles well-chilled (38-42°F) in tulip-shaped flutes or white wine glasses to preserve bubbles and concentrate aromatics. Brut pairs excellently with oysters, sushi, or aged cheeses, while Extra Dry complements fruit-based appetizers and light pasta dishes. Dry Prosecco works best on its own as an aperitif or with mildly spiced cuisine, and premium DOCG bottles deserve proper glassware and food pairings that won't overpower their nuanced flavors.</p>
