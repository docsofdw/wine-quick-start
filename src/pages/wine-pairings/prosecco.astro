<h2>Origins & History</h2>

<p>Prosecco's story begins in the rolling hills of northeastern Italy, where the <strong>Glera grape</strong> (formerly known as Prosecco) has been cultivated for over a millennium. The variety originated in the village of Prosecco, near Trieste, where Roman writers like Pliny the Elder documented a wine called "Pucinum" as early as the first century CE—believed by many scholars to be an early ancestor of today's Prosecco.</p>

<p>The modern understanding of Glera's genetic makeup reveals fascinating parentage connections. Recent DNA analysis has linked Glera to other northeastern Italian varieties, suggesting a complex web of natural crossings that occurred over centuries in the Veneto and Friuli regions. This grape thrived in the unique terroir of steep hillsides and mineral-rich soils, developing the high acidity and delicate floral characteristics that define quality Prosecco today.</p>

<h3>The Rise to Global Recognition</h3>

<p>While Glera remained largely regional until the 20th century, several key moments transformed it into an international phenomenon. The <strong>development of the Charmat method</strong> in the early 1900s revolutionized production, allowing winemakers to preserve Glera's fresh fruit character while creating consistent, affordable sparkling wine. The establishment of the Prosecco DOC in 1969, followed by the prestigious DOCG classifications for Conegliano Valdobbiadene and Asolo in 2009, elevated the wine's status dramatically.</p>

<p>The name "Prosecco" itself underwent significant change in 2009 when EU regulations reserved the term exclusively for wines from designated Italian regions, forcing the grape to be renamed Glera. This protected designation sparked a global planting boom, with <strong>over 25,000 hectares</strong> now under vine in the traditional zones alone.</p>

<h3>Global Expansion and Modern Trends</h3>

<p>Today, while authentic Prosecco remains tied to its Italian origins, Glera plantings have expanded worldwide. Australia, Argentina, and parts of California now cultivate the variety, though these wines cannot legally use the Prosecco name. The variety's adaptability to different climates, combined with growing consumer demand for accessible sparkling wines, has made it one of the fastest-growing wine categories globally, with production increasing over 300% in the past two decades.</p>

<h2>Grape Characteristics & Winemaking</h2>

<h3>Viticulture: Growing the Glera Grape</h3>
<p>Prosecco's foundation lies in the <strong>Glera grape</strong> (formerly known as Prosecco), a variety that thrives in the cool, humid climate of Italy's Veneto and Friuli regions. This vigorous vine requires careful canopy management to prevent excessive vegetative growth that can dilute flavors. Glera performs best on well-drained soils with good sun exposure, particularly the steep hillsides of Valdobbiadene where diurnal temperature variation preserves crucial acidity. Harvest timing is critical—picked too early, the grapes lack aromatic intensity; too late, and the bright acidity that defines quality Prosecco begins to fade. Most producers harvest between mid-September and early October at 10.5-11.5% potential alcohol.</p>

<h3>Winemaking: The Charmat Method</h3>
<p>The <strong>Charmat method</strong> (Metodo Italiano) defines Prosecco production, conducting secondary fermentation in pressurized stainless steel tanks rather than individual bottles. This technique, developed by Federico Martinotti and refined by Eugène Charmat, preserves Glera's delicate floral aromatics and fresh fruit character. Primary fermentation occurs in temperature-controlled stainless steel tanks at 60-64°F to maintain varietal purity. <strong>Malolactic fermentation is typically avoided</strong> to preserve the grape's naturally crisp malic acidity. Oak aging is extremely rare, as it would mask Glera's subtle mineral and fruit characteristics that consumers expect from authentic Prosecco.</p>

<h3>Regional Expression</h3>
<p>Terroir significantly impacts Prosecco's character across its three main appellations. <strong>Prosecco DOC</strong> from the broader plains tends toward approachable, fruit-forward styles with apple and pear notes. <strong>Prosecco di Conegliano Valdobbiadene DOCG</strong> shows greater complexity, with pronounced mineral undertones from the region's limestone-rich soils and more concentrated flavors due to hillside cultivation. The prestigious <strong>Rive</strong> designations from specific vineyard sites exhibit the most terroir expression, often displaying white peach intensity, acacia honey nuances, and distinctive chalky minerality that reflects the steep slopes' unique microclimates.</p>

<h3>Quality Markers & Aging Potential</h3>
<p>Superior Prosecco exhibits <strong>persistent, fine bubbles</strong> with a creamy mousse, indicating proper secondary fermentation management. The best examples balance vibrant acidity (7-8 g/L) with subtle residual sugar, creating wines that feel dry yet approachable. Quality producers maintain lower yields (12-15 tons per hectare versus 18+ for basic DOC) and employ longer lees contact during secondary fermentation for enhanced texture and complexity.</p>

<p>Unlike Champagne, Prosecco is designed for immediate consumption, typically within <strong>2-3 years of vintage</strong>. However, exceptional Prosecco di Valdobbiadene can develop honeyed complexity and deeper mineral characteristics over 5-7 years when properly stored, though the signature bright effervescence gradually diminishes.</p>
```

<h2>What Does Prosecco Taste Like?</h2>

<h3 class="text-wine-700">Appearance and Visual Cues</h3>
<p>Quality Prosecco displays a pale straw to light golden color, with premium examples like <strong>Prosecco di Valdobbiadene DOCG</strong> showing brilliant clarity and persistent, fine-beaded effervescence. The mousse (foam) should be creamy white and long-lasting—a sign of quality fermentation and proper riddling. Younger Proseccos maintain that crystalline pale yellow hue, while extended lees contact in premium bottles may deepen the color slightly to golden-tinged straw.</p>

<h3 class="text-wine-700">Aromatic Profile</h3>
<p>Prosecco's <strong>primary aromatics</strong> burst with fresh orchard fruits—crisp Granny Smith apple, ripe pear, and white peach dominate, thanks to the Glera grape's naturally high malic acid content. <strong>Secondary fermentation notes</strong> contribute subtle bread dough and brioche characteristics, particularly in premium examples that undergo longer lees contact. Look for delicate floral notes of acacia blossom and wisteria, hallmarks of high-altitude Valdobbiadene vineyards. <strong>Tertiary development</strong> in aged Proseccos reveals honeyed nuances and toasted almond complexity.</p>

<h3 class="text-wine-700">Palate Structure and Mouthfeel</h3>
<p>Authentic Prosecco presents a <strong>light to medium body</strong> with vibrant acidity (typically 6-7 g/L tartaric acid equivalent) that creates its signature refreshing character. The texture should feel creamy yet lively, with fine bubbles creating a gentle prickling sensation rather than aggressive effervescence. Alcohol levels range from 11-12.5% ABV, providing warmth without overwhelming the delicate fruit profile.</p>

<h3 class="text-wine-700">Flavor Development and Finish</h3>
<p>On the palate, expect <strong>green apple and pear flavors</strong> to lead, followed by citrus zest—particularly lime and lemon—that amplifies the wine's natural acidity. Premium Proseccos from Conegliano-Valdobbiadene reveal subtle <strong>mineral undertones</strong> from the region's limestone-rich soils, adding complexity to the fruit-forward profile. A touch of white pepper and fresh herbs often appears in superior examples.</p>

<p class="bg-wine-50 p-4 rounded">The <strong>finish</strong> in quality Prosecco should be clean and refreshing, lasting 8-12 seconds with lingering apple and citrus notes. Premium bottles display greater persistence and complexity, with subtle almond and brioche notes extending the aftertaste.</p>

<h3 class="text-wine-700">Quality Indicators</h3>
<p>Superior Proseccos showcase <strong>balanced integration</strong> between fruit, acidity, and effervescence, with no single element dominating. Look for wines with persistent mousse, complex aromatics beyond simple fruit, and clean, lengthy finishes that invite another sip.</p>

<h2>Origins & History</h2>

<p>Prosecco's remarkable journey from a humble northeastern Italian grape to a global sparkling wine phenomenon spans centuries of winemaking evolution. The variety's story begins with <strong>Glera</strong>, the grape's official name since 2009, which has thrived in the Veneto and Friuli regions for over a millennium.</p>

<h3>Ancient Roots and Geographic Origins</h3>

<p>Historical records trace Glera cultivation back to Roman times, when the grape flourished in the hills surrounding modern-day Conegliano and Valdobbiadene. The name "Prosecco" itself derives from the village of Prosecco near Trieste, where this aromatic variety was first documented in the 16th century. Italian ampelographers have confirmed through DNA analysis that Glera is indigenous to northeastern Italy, with genetic markers linking it specifically to the steep, mineral-rich soils of the Treviso province.</p>

<h3>The Charmat Method Revolution</h3>

<p>While Prosecco existed as a still wine for centuries, its transformation into the sparkling wine we know today occurred in the early 1900s. <strong>Federico Martinotti's invention of the tank fermentation method</strong> in 1895, later refined by Eugène Charmat, revolutionized Prosecco production. This technique preserved the grape's delicate floral aromatics—notes of green apple, white peach, and acacia blossom—that would be lost in traditional bottle fermentation.</p>

<h3>Modern Recognition and Global Expansion</h3>

<p>Prosecco's international breakthrough came in the 1960s when Italian producers began marketing it as an elegant, approachable alternative to Champagne. The establishment of <strong>DOCG status for Conegliano Valdobbiadene in 2009</strong> marked a pivotal moment, protecting the most prestigious production zones while distinguishing quality levels.</p>

<p>Today, Prosecco production has expanded beyond Italy's borders, with notable plantings in Australia's King Valley, Brazil's Serra Gaúcha, and Argentina's high-altitude regions. However, <strong>over 90% of global Prosecco still originates from Italy</strong>, where approximately 25,000 hectares of Glera vines produce more than 600 million bottles annually, making it one of the world's most successful sparkling wine categories.</p>

<h2>Grape Characteristics & Winemaking</h2>

<p>Glera, the primary grape behind Prosecco, is a vigorous, high-yielding variety that thrives in the cool, hillside vineyards of Veneto and Friuli-Venezia Giulia. This naturally productive grape requires careful canopy management to maintain quality, with yields legally capped at 13.5 tons per hectare in DOCG zones and 18 tons in DOC areas. The grape's thin skins and tight clusters make it susceptible to botrytis, demanding meticulous vineyard timing and selective harvesting, typically occurring in early to mid-September when acids remain crisp and sugars reach 9.5-10.5% potential alcohol.</p>

<h3 class="text-wine-700">Fermentation Philosophy</h3>

<p>Prosecco's signature freshness stems from the <strong>Charmat method</strong> (Metodo Martinotti), where secondary fermentation occurs in temperature-controlled stainless steel tanks rather than individual bottles. This technique preserves Glera's delicate floral aromatics—particularly white flowers, green apple, and citrus zest—while maintaining the grape's characteristic minerality. Primary fermentation typically occurs at 16-18°C over 15-20 days, followed by secondary fermentation at 12-14°C for 30-40 days. Malolactic fermentation is deliberately avoided to preserve the wine's vibrant acidity, which ranges from 6-7 g/L tartaric acid equivalent.</p>

<h3 class="text-wine-700">Regional Expression</h3>

<p>Glera's terroir sensitivity becomes evident across Prosecco's hierarchy. In the prestigious <strong>Conegliano Valdobbiadene DOCG</strong>, steep slopes with calcareous-clay soils and significant diurnal temperature variation produce wines with intense minerality, complex white fruit flavors, and remarkable longevity. The subzone of Cartizze, with its unique microclimate and ancient marine sediments, yields Proseccos of extraordinary finesse and concentration. In contrast, the broader Prosecco DOC encompasses flatter vineyard sites that produce approachable, fruit-forward wines with softer acidity and broader appeal.</p>

<h3 class="text-wine-700">Quality Markers</h3>

<p>Superior Proseccos exhibit several telltale characteristics: a persistent, fine mousse with pinpoint bubbles indicating proper secondary fermentation; aromatic complexity beyond simple fruit, including honey, almond blossom, and subtle herb notes; and a long, mineral-driven finish that reflects true terroir expression. The best examples show <strong>textural depth</strong> from extended lees contact and demonstrate the grape's ability to balance richness with refreshing acidity.</p>

<h3 class="text-wine-700">Evolution and Aging</h3>

<p>While designed for immediate consumption, quality Proseccos can evolve beautifully for 2-4 years. Base wines from top producers develop honeyed complexity, toasted bread notes, and deeper fruit concentration while maintaining their essential vivacity. Vintage-dated Proseccos from exceptional years, particularly from Conegliano Valdobbiadene's premier sites, can age gracefully for up to six years, developing nuanced tertiary aromas that showcase Glera's surprising aging potential.</p>

<h2>What Does Prosecco Taste Like?</h2>

<h3>Appearance: Visual Clues to Quality</h3>
<p>Quality Prosecco displays a <strong>pale straw to light gold color</strong>, with the deepest hues typically found in DOCG expressions from Valdobbiadene and Conegliano. The wine should show brilliant clarity with persistent, fine bubbles forming a steady mousse—a visual indicator of proper secondary fermentation. <strong>Coarser, larger bubbles suggest lower quality</strong> or improper handling, while the finest Proseccos exhibit what Italians call "perlage fine," tiny bubbles that rise in elegant chains.</p>

<h3>Aromatics: From Orchard to Glass</h3>
<p>Prosecco's aromatic profile centers on <strong>primary fruit aromatics</strong> that showcase the Glera grape's inherent freshness. Expect vibrant notes of green apple, pear, and white peach, often accompanied by citrus zest—particularly lemon and grapefruit. <strong>Secondary fermentation aromas</strong> contribute subtle bread crust and brioche notes in premium examples, while floral elements like acacia blossom and wisteria add complexity.</p>

<p>Superior Proseccos from hillside vineyards often display <strong>mineral undertones</strong>—limestone and wet stone characteristics derived from the calcareous soils of the Prosecco DOCG zone. These tertiary aromatics distinguish exceptional bottles from everyday expressions.</p>

<h3>Palate: Texture and Structure</h3>
<p>Prosecco typically presents a <strong>light to medium body</strong> with vibrant acidity that creates a refreshing, mouth-watering sensation. The carbonation should feel creamy rather than aggressive, with fine bubbles that enhance rather than overwhelm the fruit flavors. Alcohol levels usually range from 11-12%, providing a subtle warming sensation without heaviness.</p>

<h3>Flavor Profile: The Glera Expression</h3>
<p>On the palate, expect a continuation of the aromatic profile: <strong>crisp green apple and ripe pear dominate</strong>, supported by citrus notes that provide brightness and lift. Premium examples often show subtle almond and honey nuances, while the finest DOCG Proseccos reveal delicate mineral salinity that speaks to their unique terroir.</p>

<h3>Finish and Quality Markers</h3>
<p>Quality Prosecco delivers a <strong>clean, refreshing finish</strong> with lingering fruit and a subtle mineral note. Superior examples maintain their flavor intensity through a medium-length finish, while basic Proseccos tend to fade quickly.</p>

<p><strong>Premium quality indicators include</strong>: persistent fine bubbles, complex aromatics beyond simple fruit, noticeable minerality, and a finish that invites the next sip rather than leaving the palate feeling stripped or overly dry.</p>

  <h2>Expert Tips</h2>
<ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-4 text-gray-700">
  <li><strong>Decode the Quality Hierarchy Through DOCG vs DOC Designations</strong> - Prosecco di Conegliano e Valdobbiadene DOCG represents the premium tier, with stricter vineyard regulations and hand-harvesting requirements that create more complex, mineral-driven wines. Standard Prosecco DOC covers a much larger area and typically uses tank fermentation for 30-90 days versus the DOCG's longer lees contact. When comparing options, DOCG bottles will show more citrus peel complexity and finer bubbles, justifying their 40-60% price premium over DOC versions.</li>

  <li><strong>Identify Superior Options by Reading Residual Sugar Levels</strong> - Brut Nature (0-3g/L) and Extra Brut (0-6g/L) classifications reveal the winemaker's confidence in their base wine quality, as these dry styles can't mask flaws with sweetness. Cartizze DOCG, from prosecco's grand cru vineyard, excels in these bone-dry styles due to its steep, south-facing slopes that concentrate flavors naturally. Compare labels carefully—many mass-market proseccos rely on Extra Dry (12-17g/L) to appeal to broader palates but sacrifice the grape's natural acidity.</li>

  <li><strong>Serve at Precisely 42-46°F to Distinguish Quality Levels</strong> - Premium proseccos reveal their terroir complexity when served at the warmer end of this range (45-46°F), allowing mineral notes from the region's limestone-clay soils to emerge. Mass-market options benefit from colder service (42-43°F) as the lower temperature masks any harsh acetaldehyde or green apple notes from rushed production. Use this temperature differential as a tasting strategy when comparing multiple bottles side by side.</li>

  <li><strong>Choose Flute vs. Tulip Glasses Based on Prosecco Style</strong> - Traditional flutes work best for highly carbonated, fruit-forward DOC proseccos as the narrow opening preserves the mousse and concentrates primary fruit aromas. However, premium DOCG proseccos—especially those from single vineyards like Rive designations—benefit from tulip-shaped glasses that allow the wine's secondary characteristics (brioche, almond, white flowers) to develop, revealing why you're paying 2-3 times more than standard options.</li>

  <li><strong>Never Decant, But Master the Opening Technique for Quality Assessment</strong> - Prosecco should never be decanted as it destroys the carefully calibrated CO2 levels (typically 5-6 atmospheres). Instead, use the opening sound and cork condition as quality indicators: premium bottles produce a gentle "whisper" rather than a loud pop, and the cork should be moist throughout, indicating proper riddling and disgorgement. Dry, crumbling corks often signal rushed production or poor storage in lower-tier options.</li>

  <li><strong>Consume Within 1-3 Years, But Premium Options Peak at 2-3 Years</strong> - While most DOC proseccos should be consumed within 12-18 months of release, DOCG proseccos—particularly Superiore di Cartizze—develop honeyed complexity and integrated bubbles over 2-3 years. Look for vintage dates on premium bottles; producers like Bisol, Nino Franco, and Ruggeri often hold back their best cuvées for 18-24 months before release, allowing the wine to develop tertiary aromas that justify their premium positioning.</li>

  <li><strong>Time Your Purchase Around Harvest for Best Value Comparisons</strong> - New vintages of premium prosecco typically release in March-April, making this the ideal time to compare current and previous vintages side by side. Many quality producers offer library releases of their Rive (single vineyard) designations, allowing you to taste how prosecco develops bottle age—something impossible with mass-market brands that prioritize immediate consumption and consistent year-round availability.</li>

  <li><strong>Distinguish Charmat Method Quality by Bubble Persistence and Size</strong> - Premium proseccos undergo slower, temperature-controlled secondary fermentation (14-16°C for 30-40 days) creating smaller, more persistent bubbles that form elegant chains in the glass. Lower-quality options often rush this process at higher temperatures, resulting in larger, more aggressive bubbles that dissipate quickly. Count the seconds: quality prosecco maintains active bubbles for 3-4 minutes after pouring, while inferior versions go flat within 90 seconds.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Aging & Cellaring</h2>

<p>Unlike many still wines, prosecco's aging potential varies dramatically based on production method and quality tier. Understanding these differences is crucial for maximizing your investment in different prosecco options.</p>

<h3>Aging Potential by Style</h3>
<p><strong>Prosecco DOC</strong> (tank method): Best consumed within 1-2 years of vintage. The fresh, primary fruit flavors—green apple, pear, and citrus—begin to fade after 18 months, with the signature effervescence losing its vivacity.</p>

<p><strong>Prosecco DOCG Superiore</strong>: Can develop beautifully for 3-5 years when properly stored. Valdobbiadene and Conegliano examples gain honeyed complexity while maintaining their mineral backbone from the steep hillside soils.</p>

<p><strong>Metodo Classico Prosecco</strong>: The rare bottle-fermented versions can age 5-8 years, developing brioche, almond, and nutty autolysis characters similar to Champagne, though retaining prosecco's distinctive glera grape profile.</p>

<h3>Evolution Over Time</h3>
<p>Prosecco doesn't follow traditional wine aging patterns. Rather than tannin integration (glera has minimal tannins), you'll notice fruit evolution from bright primary flavors to more honeyed, dried fruit notes. The perlage becomes finer but less vigorous, and the wine's natural acidity provides the structure for graceful aging in premium examples.</p>

<h3>Proper Storage</h3>
<p>Store bottles horizontally at 50-55°F with 70% humidity in a dark environment. Unlike still wines, prosecco's cork allows minimal oxygen exchange, making temperature stability more critical than for wines with traditional corks.</p>

<h3>Quality Indicators</h3>
<p>Properly aged prosecco maintains bright acidity with evolved fruit complexity. Warning signs include browning color, flat effervescence, or oxidized aromas reminiscent of bruised apples. Premium DOCG examples should show golden hues and integrated bubbles when properly cellared, while basic DOC proseccos simply lose their youthful charm rather than gaining complexity.</p>

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<div class="space-y-6">
  <div>
    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-wine-700 mb-2">What's the difference between Prosecco DOCG and DOC quality levels?</h3>
    <p class="text-gray-700">Prosecco DOCG (from Conegliano Valdobbiadene and Asolo) represents the highest quality tier, produced from hillside vineyards with stricter regulations and lower yields. DOC Prosecco covers the broader Veneto and Friuli regions with more relaxed standards, resulting in generally lighter, simpler wines. DOCG wines typically cost $15-40 while DOC versions range from $8-20, making the quality difference significant for special occasions.</p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-wine-700 mb-2">How do Extra Dry, Brut, and Demi-Sec Prosecco styles compare for different occasions?</h3>
    <p class="text-gray-700">Extra Dry Prosecco (12-17g/L residual sugar) offers the most food-friendly balance with subtle sweetness that complements appetizers and seafood. Brut (0-12g/L) provides the driest, most elegant style perfect for toasting and pairing with oysters or caviar. Demi-Sec (17-32g/L) works beautifully with desserts or spicy Asian cuisine, though it's less common in the U.S. market.</p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-wine-700 mb-2">Which Prosecco producers offer the best value under $20?</h3>
    <p class="text-gray-700">Mionetto Prosecco di Valdobbiadene DOCG consistently delivers exceptional quality around $15-18, offering the complexity of premium hillside fruit. La Marca provides reliable DOC quality at $10-12 with clean apple and citrus flavors, while Bisol Jeio Prosecco di Valdobbiadene DOCG offers mineral-driven elegance at $16-20. These producers maintain consistent quality across vintages and wide distribution.</p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-wine-700 mb-2">What's the ideal serving temperature difference between premium and everyday Prosecco?</h3>
    <p class="text-gray-700">Premium DOCG Prosecco should be served slightly warmer at 45-48°F to showcase its complex mineral and floral notes, similar to Champagne service. Everyday DOC Prosecco performs best at 40-43°F, emphasizing its fresh, fruity character and crisp acidity. Over-chilling premium bottles (below 40°F) masks their terroir-driven complexity, while under-chilling basic Prosecco can make it taste flabby and overly sweet.</p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-wine-700 mb-2">How long can different Prosecco quality levels be stored after opening?</h3>
    <p class="text-gray-700">High-quality DOCG Prosecco maintains effervescence and flavor for 2-3 days when properly resealed and refrigerated, thanks to finer bubbles and higher acidity. Standard DOC Prosecco typically loses its sparkle within 24 hours due to larger bubbles and lower pressure. Using a proper sparkling wine stopper rather than a regular cork extends freshness by 12-24 hours for any style.</p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-wine-700 mb-2">What are the biggest mistakes when choosing Prosecco for special events?</h3>
    <p class="text-gray-700">The most common error is selecting the wrong sweetness level—many choose Demi-Sec thinking it's drier when Extra Dry is actually the crowd-pleasing middle ground. Another mistake is buying too far in advance; Prosecco should be consumed within 1-2 years of release for optimal freshness. Finally, people often overlook serving vessel—flute glasses concentrate aromas better than coupes for most Prosecco styles.</p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-wine-700 mb-2">When should I choose Franciacorta or Cava instead of Prosecco?</h3>
    <p class="text-gray-700">Choose Franciacorta when you want Champagne-style complexity and aging potential for formal occasions—its traditional method produces more sophisticated bubbles and flavors. Cava offers better value for large gatherings where you need sparkling wine with food-pairing versatility, especially with Spanish or Mediterranean cuisine. Stick with Prosecco for casual celebrations, aperitifs, or when you prefer fresh, fruit-forward flavors over yeasty, bread-like complexity.</p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibeland text-wine-700 mb-2">How do organic and biodynamic Prosecco options compare to conventional ones?</h3>
    <p class="text-gray-700">Organic Prosecco producers like Ca' dei Zago and Astoria often show more pronounced minerality and terroir expression, though at a 20-30% price premium. Biodynamic versions from producers like Perlage exhibit exceptional purity but limited availability outside specialty wine shops. The flavor differences are subtle—conventional Prosecco can be equally delicious, making organic/biodynamic choices more about personal values than dramatic taste improvements.</p>
