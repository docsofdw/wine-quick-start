<h2>Origins & History</h2>

<p>Prosecco's remarkable journey from a humble northeastern Italian grape to a global sparkling wine phenomenon spans centuries of winemaking evolution. The variety's story begins with <strong>Glera</strong>, the grape's official name since 2009, which has thrived in the Veneto and Friuli regions for over a millennium.</p>

<h3>Ancient Roots and Geographic Origins</h3>

<p>Historical records trace Glera cultivation back to Roman times, when the grape flourished in the hills surrounding modern-day Conegliano and Valdobbiadene. The name "Prosecco" itself derives from the village of Prosecco near Trieste, where this aromatic variety was first documented in the 16th century. Italian ampelographers have confirmed through DNA analysis that Glera is indigenous to northeastern Italy, with genetic markers linking it specifically to the steep, mineral-rich soils of the Treviso province.</p>

<h3>The Charmat Method Revolution</h3>

<p>While Prosecco existed as a still wine for centuries, its transformation into the sparkling wine we know today occurred in the early 1900s. <strong>Federico Martinotti's invention of the tank fermentation method</strong> in 1895, later refined by Eugène Charmat, revolutionized Prosecco production. This technique preserved the grape's delicate floral aromatics—notes of green apple, white peach, and acacia blossom—that would be lost in traditional bottle fermentation.</p>

<h3>Modern Recognition and Global Expansion</h3>

<p>Prosecco's international breakthrough came in the 1960s when Italian producers began marketing it as an elegant, approachable alternative to Champagne. The establishment of <strong>DOCG status for Conegliano Valdobbiadene in 2009</strong> marked a pivotal moment, protecting the most prestigious production zones while distinguishing quality levels.</p>

<p>Today, Prosecco production has expanded beyond Italy's borders, with notable plantings in Australia's King Valley, Brazil's Serra Gaúcha, and Argentina's high-altitude regions. However, <strong>over 90% of global Prosecco still originates from Italy</strong>, where approximately 25,000 hectares of Glera vines produce more than 600 million bottles annually, making it one of the world's most successful sparkling wine categories.</p>

<h2>Grape Characteristics & Winemaking</h2>

<p>Glera, the primary grape behind Prosecco, is a vigorous, high-yielding variety that thrives in the cool, hillside vineyards of Veneto and Friuli-Venezia Giulia. This naturally productive grape requires careful canopy management to maintain quality, with yields legally capped at 13.5 tons per hectare in DOCG zones and 18 tons in DOC areas. The grape's thin skins and tight clusters make it susceptible to botrytis, demanding meticulous vineyard timing and selective harvesting, typically occurring in early to mid-September when acids remain crisp and sugars reach 9.5-10.5% potential alcohol.</p>

<h3 class="text-wine-700">Fermentation Philosophy</h3>

<p>Prosecco's signature freshness stems from the <strong>Charmat method</strong> (Metodo Martinotti), where secondary fermentation occurs in temperature-controlled stainless steel tanks rather than individual bottles. This technique preserves Glera's delicate floral aromatics—particularly white flowers, green apple, and citrus zest—while maintaining the grape's characteristic minerality. Primary fermentation typically occurs at 16-18°C over 15-20 days, followed by secondary fermentation at 12-14°C for 30-40 days. Malolactic fermentation is deliberately avoided to preserve the wine's vibrant acidity, which ranges from 6-7 g/L tartaric acid equivalent.</p>

<h3 class="text-wine-700">Regional Expression</h3>

<p>Glera's terroir sensitivity becomes evident across Prosecco's hierarchy. In the prestigious <strong>Conegliano Valdobbiadene DOCG</strong>, steep slopes with calcareous-clay soils and significant diurnal temperature variation produce wines with intense minerality, complex white fruit flavors, and remarkable longevity. The subzone of Cartizze, with its unique microclimate and ancient marine sediments, yields Proseccos of extraordinary finesse and concentration. In contrast, the broader Prosecco DOC encompasses flatter vineyard sites that produce approachable, fruit-forward wines with softer acidity and broader appeal.</p>

<h3 class="text-wine-700">Quality Markers</h3>

<p>Superior Proseccos exhibit several telltale characteristics: a persistent, fine mousse with pinpoint bubbles indicating proper secondary fermentation; aromatic complexity beyond simple fruit, including honey, almond blossom, and subtle herb notes; and a long, mineral-driven finish that reflects true terroir expression. The best examples show <strong>textural depth</strong> from extended lees contact and demonstrate the grape's ability to balance richness with refreshing acidity.</p>

<h3 class="text-wine-700">Evolution and Aging</h3>

<p>While designed for immediate consumption, quality Proseccos can evolve beautifully for 2-4 years. Base wines from top producers develop honeyed complexity, toasted bread notes, and deeper fruit concentration while maintaining their essential vivacity. Vintage-dated Proseccos from exceptional years, particularly from Conegliano Valdobbiadene's premier sites, can age gracefully for up to six years, developing nuanced tertiary aromas that showcase Glera's surprising aging potential.</p>

<h2>What Does Prosecco Taste Like?</h2>

<h3>Appearance: Visual Clues to Quality</h3>
<p>Quality Prosecco displays a <strong>pale straw to light gold color</strong>, with the deepest hues typically found in DOCG expressions from Valdobbiadene and Conegliano. The wine should show brilliant clarity with persistent, fine bubbles forming a steady mousse—a visual indicator of proper secondary fermentation. <strong>Coarser, larger bubbles suggest lower quality</strong> or improper handling, while the finest Proseccos exhibit what Italians call "perlage fine," tiny bubbles that rise in elegant chains.</p>

<h3>Aromatics: From Orchard to Glass</h3>
<p>Prosecco's aromatic profile centers on <strong>primary fruit aromatics</strong> that showcase the Glera grape's inherent freshness. Expect vibrant notes of green apple, pear, and white peach, often accompanied by citrus zest—particularly lemon and grapefruit. <strong>Secondary fermentation aromas</strong> contribute subtle bread crust and brioche notes in premium examples, while floral elements like acacia blossom and wisteria add complexity.</p>

<p>Superior Proseccos from hillside vineyards often display <strong>mineral undertones</strong>—limestone and wet stone characteristics derived from the calcareous soils of the Prosecco DOCG zone. These tertiary aromatics distinguish exceptional bottles from everyday expressions.</p>

<h3>Palate: Texture and Structure</h3>
<p>Prosecco typically presents a <strong>light to medium body</strong> with vibrant acidity that creates a refreshing, mouth-watering sensation. The carbonation should feel creamy rather than aggressive, with fine bubbles that enhance rather than overwhelm the fruit flavors. Alcohol levels usually range from 11-12%, providing a subtle warming sensation without heaviness.</p>

<h3>Flavor Profile: The Glera Expression</h3>
<p>On the palate, expect a continuation of the aromatic profile: <strong>crisp green apple and ripe pear dominate</strong>, supported by citrus notes that provide brightness and lift. Premium examples often show subtle almond and honey nuances, while the finest DOCG Proseccos reveal delicate mineral salinity that speaks to their unique terroir.</p>

<h3>Finish and Quality Markers</h3>
<p>Quality Prosecco delivers a <strong>clean, refreshing finish</strong> with lingering fruit and a subtle mineral note. Superior examples maintain their flavor intensity through a medium-length finish, while basic Proseccos tend to fade quickly.</p>

<p><strong>Premium quality indicators include</strong>: persistent fine bubbles, complex aromatics beyond simple fruit, noticeable minerality, and a finish that invites the next sip rather than leaving the palate feeling stripped or overly dry.</p>
