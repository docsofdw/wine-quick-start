<h2>Origins & History</h2>

<p>Prosecco's story begins in the rolling hills of northeastern Italy, where the <strong>Glera grape</strong> (formerly known as Prosecco) has thrived for over a millennium. Historical records trace this indigenous variety back to Roman times in the village of Prosecco, near Trieste, where it earned its original name. The grape found its true calling in the Veneto region, particularly in the steep, mineral-rich soils of Valdobbiadene and Conegliano.</p>

<p>DNA analysis has revealed Glera's fascinating parentage: it's a natural cross between <strong>Glera Lunga and Malvasia Bianca Lunga</strong>, explaining its distinctive aromatic profile and natural acidity. This genetic heritage contributes to Prosecco's characteristic white flower aromatics and crisp, refreshing character that has captivated wine lovers worldwide.</p>

<p>The transformation from local curiosity to global phenomenon occurred gradually. The <strong>Charmat method</strong>, developed by Eugène Charmat in 1907, revolutionized Prosecco production by enabling tank fermentation that preserved the grape's delicate fruit flavors. This technique, adopted by forward-thinking producers like Carpené Malvolti in 1868, allowed Prosecco to maintain its fresh, approachable character while achieving consistent quality.</p>

<h3>Modern Recognition and Global Expansion</h3>

<p>Prosecco's reputation soared internationally following World War II, with exports beginning in earnest during the 1960s. The creation of <strong>DOCG status for Conegliano Valdobbiadene</strong> in 2009 elevated the finest expressions to Italy's highest quality tier, while the broader Prosecco DOC encompasses production across nine provinces.</p>

<p>Today, Prosecco represents one of wine's greatest success stories. Global plantings have expanded to over <strong>24,000 hectares</strong>, with production reaching 600 million bottles annually. While Italy remains the undisputed leader, countries including Australia, Argentina, and Brazil now cultivate Glera, though none can replicate the unique terroir of the Veneto's chalky soils and cool Alpine breezes that give authentic Prosecco its distinctive mineral backbone and elegant effervescence.</p>

<h2>Grape Characteristics & Winemaking</h2>

<p>Prosecco's foundation lies in the <strong>Glera grape</strong> (formerly known as Prosecco), a variety that thrives in the specific climatic conditions of northeastern Italy. Understanding how this grape behaves from vineyard to bottle reveals why quality varies so dramatically across different Prosecco options.</p>

<h3>Viticulture and Growing Requirements</h3>

<p>Glera is a naturally vigorous variety that requires careful canopy management to prevent overcropping. The grape performs best in well-draining soils with good sun exposure, particularly on the steep hillsides of Valdobbiadene and Conegliano where DOCG Proseccos are produced. <strong>Harvest timing is crucial</strong>—picked too early and the wines lack body; too late and they lose the bright acidity essential for quality sparkling wine. Premium producers typically harvest in late September to early October, when Glera reaches 10.5-11.5% potential alcohol with refreshing acidity levels around 7-8 g/L.</p>

<p>The best sites limit yields to 13-15 tons per hectare, though DOC regulations permit up to 18 tons. This yield difference significantly impacts concentration and ultimately, wine quality.</p>

<h3>Winemaking Techniques</h3>

<p>The <strong>Charmat method</strong> (tank fermentation) is Prosecco's defining production technique, designed to preserve Glera's delicate floral and fruit characteristics. Primary fermentation occurs in stainless steel tanks at controlled temperatures (16-18°C) to maintain freshness. Most producers avoid malolactic fermentation to preserve crisp acidity, though some premium examples undergo partial MLF for added complexity.</p>

<p>Secondary fermentation takes place in pressurized tanks with selected yeasts over 30-40 days. The wine remains on its lees during this period, contributing to texture and subtle yeasty notes. <strong>Oak is rarely used</strong>, as it would mask Glera's inherent character of white flowers, green apple, and citrus.</p>

<h3>Regional Expression</h3>

<p>Prosecco di Valdobbiadene DOCG showcases mineral-driven precision thanks to its steep, south-facing slopes and calcareous soils. Wines from Cartizze, the region's grand cru, display exceptional elegance and honeyed complexity. Prosecco di Conegliano DOCG tends toward more fruit-forward expressions, while broader DOC wines from the plains offer simpler, more commercial styles.</p>

<h3>Quality Indicators</h3>

<p>Premium Proseccos display <strong>persistent, fine bubbles</strong>, bright acidity (6-7 g/L), and complex aromatics beyond simple fruit. Look for wines showing mineral undertones, balanced residual sugar (typically 12-17 g/L for Brut), and clean, lengthy finishes. Superior examples often feature hand-harvested fruit and extended lees contact.</p>

<h3>Aging Potential</h3>

<p>Unlike Champagne, Prosecco is designed for immediate consumption. Most examples peak within 18-24 months of production, though exceptional DOCG bottlings can develop honeyed complexity over 3-4 years. The wine's fresh, primary fruit character gradually gives way to more mature notes, but extended aging typically diminishes rather than enhances quality.</p>

<h2>What Does Prosecco Taste Like?</h2>

<h3>Appearance and Visual Cues</h3>
<p>Quality Prosecco displays a pale straw to light golden color, with premium examples showing brilliant clarity and persistent, fine bubbles that rise in elegant streams. The <strong>perlage</strong> (bubble formation) reveals crucial quality indicators—finer, more persistent bubbles suggest superior production methods and fresher wine. Younger Proseccos maintain that crystalline straw hue, while aged examples may develop deeper golden tones, though most are designed for immediate consumption.</p>

<h3>Aromatic Profile</h3>
<p>Prosecco's aromatic signature begins with <strong>primary fruit aromas</strong> dominated by green apple, pear, and white peach, often accompanied by citrus notes of lemon zest and lime. The Glera grape's natural character shines through with distinctive floral elements—acacia blossoms and wisteria are hallmarks of quality examples. <strong>Secondary fermentation aromas</strong> contribute fresh bread crust and brioche notes in premium bottles, while tertiary development in longer-aged Proseccos can reveal subtle honey and almond nuances, though this is less common given the style's emphasis on freshness.</p>

<h3>Palate Structure and Texture</h3>
<p>On the palate, Prosecco typically presents a <strong>light to medium body</strong> with vibrant acidity that creates its signature refreshing character. The wine's natural effervescence provides a creamy, mousse-like texture that carries the fruit flavors beautifully. Alcohol levels usually range from 11-12.5%, contributing to the wine's approachable, easy-drinking nature without overwhelming heat.</p>

<h3>Flavor Complexity</h3>
<p>The flavor profile mirrors the aromatics with crisp green apple and ripe pear leading, supported by citrus elements that add brightness and lift. Premium Proseccos from superior vineyard sites often display subtle <strong>mineral undertones</strong>—a reflection of the calcareous soils in Valdobbiadene and Conegliano. Some examples show delicate herbal notes of fresh mint or sage, particularly from hillside vineyards where diurnal temperature variation concentrates flavors.</p>

<h3>Finish and Quality Markers</h3>
<p>Quality Prosecco delivers a <strong>clean, refreshing finish</strong> that encourages the next sip, with fruit flavors lingering pleasantly without heaviness. Premium indicators include fine, persistent bubbles, balanced acidity that doesn't feel harsh, and aromatic complexity beyond simple fruit. <strong>DOCG Proseccos</strong> from Conegliano Valdobbiadene often show superior integration of fruit, acidity, and effervescence, with a more sophisticated mineral backbone that distinguishes them from basic DOC examples.</p>

<h2>Origins & History</h2>

<p>Prosecco's remarkable journey from a humble northeastern Italian grape to a global sparkling wine phenomenon spans centuries of winemaking evolution. The variety's story begins with <strong>Glera</strong>, the grape's official name since 2009, which has thrived in the Veneto and Friuli regions for over a millennium.</p>

<h3>Ancient Roots and Geographic Origins</h3>

<p>Historical records trace Glera cultivation back to Roman times, when the grape flourished in the hills surrounding modern-day Conegliano and Valdobbiadene. The name "Prosecco" itself derives from the village of Prosecco near Trieste, where this aromatic variety was first documented in the 16th century. Italian ampelographers have confirmed through DNA analysis that Glera is indigenous to northeastern Italy, with genetic markers linking it specifically to the steep, mineral-rich soils of the Treviso province.</p>

<h3>The Charmat Method Revolution</h3>

<p>While Prosecco existed as a still wine for centuries, its transformation into the sparkling wine we know today occurred in the early 1900s. <strong>Federico Martinotti's invention of the tank fermentation method</strong> in 1895, later refined by Eugène Charmat, revolutionized Prosecco production. This technique preserved the grape's delicate floral aromatics—notes of green apple, white peach, and acacia blossom—that would be lost in traditional bottle fermentation.</p>

<h3>Modern Recognition and Global Expansion</h3>

<p>Prosecco's international breakthrough came in the 1960s when Italian producers began marketing it as an elegant, approachable alternative to Champagne. The establishment of <strong>DOCG status for Conegliano Valdobbiadene in 2009</strong> marked a pivotal moment, protecting the most prestigious production zones while distinguishing quality levels.</p>

<p>Today, Prosecco production has expanded beyond Italy's borders, with notable plantings in Australia's King Valley, Brazil's Serra Gaúcha, and Argentina's high-altitude regions. However, <strong>over 90% of global Prosecco still originates from Italy</strong>, where approximately 25,000 hectares of Glera vines produce more than 600 million bottles annually, making it one of the world's most successful sparkling wine categories.</p>

<h2>Grape Characteristics & Winemaking</h2>

<p>Glera, the primary grape behind Prosecco, is a vigorous, high-yielding variety that thrives in the cool, hillside vineyards of Veneto and Friuli-Venezia Giulia. This naturally productive grape requires careful canopy management to maintain quality, with yields legally capped at 13.5 tons per hectare in DOCG zones and 18 tons in DOC areas. The grape's thin skins and tight clusters make it susceptible to botrytis, demanding meticulous vineyard timing and selective harvesting, typically occurring in early to mid-September when acids remain crisp and sugars reach 9.5-10.5% potential alcohol.</p>

<h3 class="text-wine-700">Fermentation Philosophy</h3>

<p>Prosecco's signature freshness stems from the <strong>Charmat method</strong> (Metodo Martinotti), where secondary fermentation occurs in temperature-controlled stainless steel tanks rather than individual bottles. This technique preserves Glera's delicate floral aromatics—particularly white flowers, green apple, and citrus zest—while maintaining the grape's characteristic minerality. Primary fermentation typically occurs at 16-18°C over 15-20 days, followed by secondary fermentation at 12-14°C for 30-40 days. Malolactic fermentation is deliberately avoided to preserve the wine's vibrant acidity, which ranges from 6-7 g/L tartaric acid equivalent.</p>

<h3 class="text-wine-700">Regional Expression</h3>

<p>Glera's terroir sensitivity becomes evident across Prosecco's hierarchy. In the prestigious <strong>Conegliano Valdobbiadene DOCG</strong>, steep slopes with calcareous-clay soils and significant diurnal temperature variation produce wines with intense minerality, complex white fruit flavors, and remarkable longevity. The subzone of Cartizze, with its unique microclimate and ancient marine sediments, yields Proseccos of extraordinary finesse and concentration. In contrast, the broader Prosecco DOC encompasses flatter vineyard sites that produce approachable, fruit-forward wines with softer acidity and broader appeal.</p>

<h3 class="text-wine-700">Quality Markers</h3>

<p>Superior Proseccos exhibit several telltale characteristics: a persistent, fine mousse with pinpoint bubbles indicating proper secondary fermentation; aromatic complexity beyond simple fruit, including honey, almond blossom, and subtle herb notes; and a long, mineral-driven finish that reflects true terroir expression. The best examples show <strong>textural depth</strong> from extended lees contact and demonstrate the grape's ability to balance richness with refreshing acidity.</p>

<h3 class="text-wine-700">Evolution and Aging</h3>

<p>While designed for immediate consumption, quality Proseccos can evolve beautifully for 2-4 years. Base wines from top producers develop honeyed complexity, toasted bread notes, and deeper fruit concentration while maintaining their essential vivacity. Vintage-dated Proseccos from exceptional years, particularly from Conegliano Valdobbiadene's premier sites, can age gracefully for up to six years, developing nuanced tertiary aromas that showcase Glera's surprising aging potential.</p>

<h2>What Does Prosecco Taste Like?</h2>

<h3>Appearance: Visual Clues to Quality</h3>
<p>Quality Prosecco displays a <strong>pale straw to light gold color</strong>, with the deepest hues typically found in DOCG expressions from Valdobbiadene and Conegliano. The wine should show brilliant clarity with persistent, fine bubbles forming a steady mousse—a visual indicator of proper secondary fermentation. <strong>Coarser, larger bubbles suggest lower quality</strong> or improper handling, while the finest Proseccos exhibit what Italians call "perlage fine," tiny bubbles that rise in elegant chains.</p>

<h3>Aromatics: From Orchard to Glass</h3>
<p>Prosecco's aromatic profile centers on <strong>primary fruit aromatics</strong> that showcase the Glera grape's inherent freshness. Expect vibrant notes of green apple, pear, and white peach, often accompanied by citrus zest—particularly lemon and grapefruit. <strong>Secondary fermentation aromas</strong> contribute subtle bread crust and brioche notes in premium examples, while floral elements like acacia blossom and wisteria add complexity.</p>

<p>Superior Proseccos from hillside vineyards often display <strong>mineral undertones</strong>—limestone and wet stone characteristics derived from the calcareous soils of the Prosecco DOCG zone. These tertiary aromatics distinguish exceptional bottles from everyday expressions.</p>

<h3>Palate: Texture and Structure</h3>
<p>Prosecco typically presents a <strong>light to medium body</strong> with vibrant acidity that creates a refreshing, mouth-watering sensation. The carbonation should feel creamy rather than aggressive, with fine bubbles that enhance rather than overwhelm the fruit flavors. Alcohol levels usually range from 11-12%, providing a subtle warming sensation without heaviness.</p>

<h3>Flavor Profile: The Glera Expression</h3>
<p>On the palate, expect a continuation of the aromatic profile: <strong>crisp green apple and ripe pear dominate</strong>, supported by citrus notes that provide brightness and lift. Premium examples often show subtle almond and honey nuances, while the finest DOCG Proseccos reveal delicate mineral salinity that speaks to their unique terroir.</p>

<h3>Finish and Quality Markers</h3>
<p>Quality Prosecco delivers a <strong>clean, refreshing finish</strong> with lingering fruit and a subtle mineral note. Superior examples maintain their flavor intensity through a medium-length finish, while basic Proseccos tend to fade quickly.</p>

<p><strong>Premium quality indicators include</strong>: persistent fine bubbles, complex aromatics beyond simple fruit, noticeable minerality, and a finish that invites the next sip rather than leaving the palate feeling stripped or overly dry.</p>

  <h2>Expert Tips</h2>
<ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-4 text-gray-700">
  <li><strong>Decode the Sweetness Levels to Match Your Palate</strong> - Prosecco's sweetness classifications drastically affect how different bottles stack up. Brut Nature (0-3g/L sugar) offers bone-dry minerality perfect for oysters, while Extra Dry (12-17g/L) provides subtle sweetness ideal for aperitifs. Dry (17-32g/L) works beautifully with fruit-based desserts. Many consumers mistakenly assume "Extra Dry" means drier than "Brut," but it's actually sweeter—understanding these labels helps you choose the right style for each occasion.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Recognize Quality Differences Between DOCG, DOC, and IGT Classifications</strong> - Prosecco di Conegliano e Valdobbiadene DOCG represents the pinnacle, with hand-harvested grapes from steep hillside vineyards producing wines with complex mineral notes and fine, persistent bubbles. Prosecco DOC covers the broader Veneto and Friuli regions, offering good quality at lower prices but with less complexity. IGT Proseccos often use tank-method shortcuts and show simpler fruit flavors—knowing these designations helps you identify which bottles offer the best value at each price point.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Serve Temperature Varies by Style for Optimal Expression</strong> - Different Prosecco styles require specific serving temperatures to showcase their best qualities. Standard Proseccos shine at 6-8°C (43-46°F), preserving their fresh fruit character and lively bubbles. Premium DOCG bottles benefit from slightly warmer service at 8-10°C (46-50°F) to allow their mineral complexity and subtle autolytic notes to emerge. Over-chilling masks the nuanced differences between quality levels, making expensive bottles taste similar to basic ones.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Choose Flutes vs. Tulip Glasses Based on Prosecco Quality</strong> - Traditional flutes work well for simple, fruit-forward Proseccos, concentrating their primary aromas and maintaining bubble streams. However, premium DOCG Proseccos benefit from tulip-shaped glasses or even white wine bowls that allow their complex mineral and floral notes to develop. The wider bowl lets you appreciate the mousse quality—fine bubbles in premium bottles versus larger, more aggressive bubbles in basic versions—a key quality indicator.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Understand Vintage vs. Non-Vintage Quality Implications</strong> - Most Proseccos are non-vintage blends designed for immediate consumption, offering consistent house style year after year. Vintage Proseccos, typically from exceptional years, command higher prices but offer more complexity and aging potential of 3-5 years. The vintage designation on a Prosecco bottle signals the producer's confidence in that year's fruit quality and indicates wine worth cellaring for special occasions.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Time Your Consumption Based on Production Method</strong> - Proseccos made via the Martinotti method (tank fermentation) are best consumed within 1-2 years of release when their bright acidity and fresh fruit flavors are most vibrant. Premium producers using longer lees contact in tank create more complex wines that can handle 2-3 years of aging. Traditional method Proseccos (rare but increasingly available) can age 5-7 years, developing brioche and almond notes similar to Champagne.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Evaluate Bubble Quality as a Key Differentiator</strong> - The mousse (foam and bubble structure) reveals significant quality differences between Prosecco options. Premium bottles display fine, persistent bubbles that form elegant chains and create creamy mousse when poured. Basic Proseccos show larger, more aggressive bubbles that dissipate quickly. This difference stems from production techniques—longer fermentation times and careful riddling in quality producers versus rapid, industrial methods in budget options.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Assess Terroir Expression in Premium vs. Standard Bottlings</strong> - High-end Proseccos from specific vineyard sites like Cartizze or Rive designations express unique terroir characteristics that justify their premium pricing. Cartizze wines show distinctive white peach and acacia honey notes from their specific microclimate, while Rive wines display individual commune characteristics—Santo Stefano offers mineral precision, while Valdobbiadene shows more floral complexity. Standard Proseccos blend fruit from multiple areas, resulting in pleasant but less distinctive flavor profiles.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Aging & Cellaring</h2>

<p>Unlike many still wines, <strong>prosecco's charm lies in its youthful exuberance</strong>, though different quality tiers offer varying cellaring potential that reflects their production methods and terroir expression.</p>

<h3>Aging Potential by Quality Level</h3>

<p><strong>Prosecco DOC</strong> reaches peak quality within 18-24 months of disgorgement, with tank-method production preserving primary fruit aromatics that begin diminishing after two years. <strong>Prosecco DOCG Conegliano Valdobbiadene</strong> demonstrates superior longevity—3-5 years for most bottlings—thanks to superior vineyard sites and longer lees contact. Premium <strong>Cartizze</strong> and <strong>Rive</strong> designations can evolve beautifully for 5-8 years, developing honeyed complexity while maintaining their characteristic minerality.</p>

<h3>Evolution Characteristics</h3>

<p>Young prosecco displays vibrant green apple, pear, and citrus notes with pronounced effervescence. With proper aging, these primary fruits evolve into more complex <strong>orchard fruit and stone fruit flavors</strong>, while the mousse becomes creamier and more integrated. Prosecco DOCG develops subtle <strong>almond and brioche notes</strong> from extended lees contact, though it never reaches the oxidative complexity of traditional method sparkling wines.</p>

<h3>Optimal Storage Conditions</h3>

<p>Store prosecco at <strong>50-55°F (10-13°C)</strong> with 70% humidity in a dark environment. Unlike still wines, keep bottles <strong>upright for short-term storage</strong> (under one year) to minimize wine-cork contact, or on their side for longer aging to keep corks moist.</p>

<h3>Peak Drinking Windows</h3>

<p>Open <strong>Prosecco DOC within 2 years</strong> for optimal freshness. <strong>DOCG bottlings shine between years 2-4</strong>, when fruit intensity balances with emerging complexity. <strong>Cartizze reaches peak elegance at 3-5 years</strong>, displaying its signature floral refinement.</p>

<p>Signs of proper aging include <strong>deeper golden color and integrated bubbles</strong>. Avoid bottles showing browning, flat aromatics, or excessive sediment—indicators of oxidation or heat damage.</p>

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<div class="space-y-6">
  <div>
    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-wine-700 mb-2">What's the difference between Prosecco DOCG and DOC, and which should I choose?</h3>
    <p class="text-gray-700">Prosecco DOCG (like Conegliano Valdobbiadene) comes from premium hillside vineyards with stricter regulations and typically offers more complexity and minerality than DOC Prosecco. DOCG bottles cost $18-35 and deliver superior terroir expression, while DOC Prosecco ($8-15) provides excellent everyday drinking value. Choose DOCG for special occasions or when you want to experience Prosecco's finest expression, and DOC for casual entertaining or mixing.</p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-wine-700 mb-2">How do Brut, Extra Dry, and Dry Prosecco compare in sweetness levels?</h3>
    <p class="text-gray-700">Counterintuitively, "Dry" Prosecco is the sweetest (17-32g/L residual sugar), followed by "Extra Dry" (12-17g/L), with "Brut" being the driest (0-12g/L). Brut offers crisp minerality perfect for aperitifs, Extra Dry provides balanced fruitiness ideal for food pairing, and Dry delivers noticeable sweetness that complements spicy cuisine or desserts. Most premium producers focus on Brut and Extra Dry styles for their complexity.</p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-wine-700 mb-2">Is Prosecco di Valdobbiadene worth the extra cost compared to regular Prosecco?</h3>
    <p class="text-gray-700">Prosecco di Valdobbiadene DOCG typically costs 2-3 times more than basic DOC Prosecco but offers significantly more complexity, with distinctive chalk and mineral notes from its UNESCO World Heritage vineyards. The steep hillside terroir and hand-harvesting requirements create wines with better aging potential and food-pairing versatility. For wine enthusiasts or special occasions, the quality difference justifies the premium, though DOC Prosecco remains excellent for everyday enjoyment.</p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-wine-700 mb-2">Should I choose tank method or traditional method sparkling wine from Veneto?</h3>
    <p class="text-gray-700">Prosecco uses the tank method (Charmat) to preserve fresh fruit flavors and floral aromatics, while traditional method wines like Franciacorta develop toasty, brioche-like complexity from lees aging. Choose Prosecco when you want bright apple and pear notes with delicate bubbles, and traditional method when you prefer richer, more complex sparkling wines. Both methods produce excellent wines, but serve different style preferences and price points.</p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-wine-700 mb-2">What are the biggest mistakes people make when selecting Prosecco?</h3>
    <p class="text-gray-700">The most common mistake is assuming all Prosecco tastes the same—quality varies dramatically between mass-market brands and estate producers like Nino Franco or Bisol. Many people also overlook the sweetness level, choosing "Dry" when they want crisp wine, or serve Prosecco too warm, which masks its delicate aromatics. Always check the DOCG/DOC designation and serve at 40-45°F for optimal expression.</p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-wine-700 mb-2">How long does Prosecco stay fresh after opening compared to other sparkling wines?</h3>
    <p class="text-gray-700">Prosecco typically maintains its best quality for 1-3 days after opening when properly sealed and refrigerated, shorter than traditional method sparkling wines due to larger, less persistent bubbles. Use a proper sparkling wine stopper rather than a regular cork, and consume tank method Prosecco sooner than bottle-fermented wines. The fresh fruit character that makes Prosecco appealing also makes it more susceptible to oxidation than aged sparkling wines.</p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-wine-700 mb-2">What alternatives should I consider if I enjoy Prosecco's style?</h3>
    <p class="text-gray-700">Try Cava from Spain for similar fresh fruit character at lower prices, or explore other Italian sparkling wines like Franciacorta for more complexity, or Lambrusco for food-friendly versatility. Austrian Grüner Veltliner Sekt offers comparable minerality and freshness, while Loire Valley Crémant provides elegant alternatives with different grape varieties. These options expand your sparkling wine repertoire while maintaining the approachable, food-friendly style that makes Prosecco popular.</p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-wine-700 mb-2">Which Prosecco producers offer the best value in different price ranges?</h3>
    <p class="text-gray-700">In the $10-15 range, La Marca and Mionetto offer consistent quality, while $15-25 brings excellent options like Nino Franco Rustico and Villa Sandi. For premium experiences ($25-40), seek out Bisol, Adami, or Case Bianche from top DOCG zones. These producers maintain quality across vintages and offer authentic expressions of their respective terroirs, providing better value than mass-market brands at similar price points.</p>
