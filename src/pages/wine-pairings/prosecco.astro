<h2>Origins & History</h2>

<p>The story of Prosecco begins in the windswept hills of northeast Italy, where the indigenous <strong>Glera grape</strong> (formerly known as Prosecco) has thrived for over a millennium. Archaeological evidence suggests that sparkling wine production in the Veneto and Friuli regions dates back to Roman times, though the modern Prosecco we know today emerged much later.</p>

<p>The name itself carries fascinating etymology. Most wine historians believe "Prosecco" derives from the village of Prosecco (now Prosek) near Trieste, where the grape was first documented in the 16th century. However, some scholars argue it stems from the Latin "prosecum," meaning "to cut through," referencing the wine's crisp, cutting acidity.</p>

<h3>The Glera Revolution</h3>

<p>A pivotal moment came in 2009 when Italian wine authorities officially renamed the grape variety from Prosecco to <strong>Glera</strong>, reserving "Prosecco" exclusively for wines produced in designated Italian regions. This legal maneuver protected the name while allowing the grape itself to be planted globally under its historical moniker.</p>

<p>The transformation from rustic regional wine to international sensation accelerated in the 1960s when producers in Valdobbiadene and Conegliano perfected the <strong>Charmat method</strong>. This tank fermentation technique, pioneered by Federico Martinotti and refined by Eugène Charmat, preserved Glera's delicate floral aromatics and fresh fruit character better than traditional bottle fermentation.</p>

<h3>Global Expansion and Modern Success</h3>

<p>Today, Glera plantings span from <strong>Australia's King Valley</strong> to <strong>California's Central Coast</strong>, with notable success in Argentina's high-altitude regions and England's chalky soils. However, Italy remains the undisputed leader, with over 20,000 hectares dedicated to Prosecco production.</p>

<p>The grape's genetic profile reveals fascinating parentage: DNA analysis confirms Glera as a distinct variety with ancient Venetian origins, though some ampelographers suggest possible connections to Croatian indigenous varieties. This heritage explains its exceptional adaptation to cool, hillside terroirs and its remarkable ability to express minerality while maintaining approachable fruitiness.</p>

<h2>Grape Characteristics & Winemaking</h2>

<p>Glera, the primary grape behind Prosecco, is a vigorous variety that thrives in the cool, humid climate of the Veneto region. This grape's naturally high acidity and delicate aromatics make it ideally suited for sparkling wine production, but its characteristics vary significantly based on cultivation methods and winemaking techniques.</p>

<h3 class="text-wine-700">Viticulture and Terroir Expression</h3>

<p>Glera is a naturally high-yielding variety that requires careful canopy management to maintain quality. In the prestigious Prosecco DOCG zones of Conegliano Valdobbiadene and Asolo, vines are typically trained using the Sylvoz system on steep hillside vineyards with calcareous-clay soils. These challenging sites naturally limit yields to around 135 hectoliters per hectare, concentrating flavors and enhancing the grape's characteristic green apple and white flower aromatics.</p>

<p>Harvest timing is crucial for Prosecco quality. Early September picking preserves the grape's essential acidity (typically 7-8 g/L tartaric acid) while capturing delicate primary fruit flavors. The cooler microclimate of hillside vineyards allows for extended hang time, developing complexity while maintaining the bright, fresh character that defines premium Prosecco.</p>

<h3 class="text-wine-700">Winemaking Techniques</h3>

<p><strong>Tank Method Fermentation</strong> (Charmat-Martinotti) is the cornerstone of Prosecco production, preserving Glera's inherent fruit purity. Primary fermentation occurs in temperature-controlled stainless steel tanks at 64-68°F, followed by secondary fermentation under pressure to create effervescence. This process typically takes 30-40 days, allowing controlled development of the wine's signature pear, citrus, and floral notes.</p>

<p>Unlike Champagne, Prosecco deliberately avoids malolactic fermentation and oak aging. This preserves the grape's natural malic acid content, contributing to the wine's refreshing tartness and clean mineral finish. The best producers use selected indigenous yeasts and minimal sulfur additions to maintain Glera's delicate aromatics.</p>

<h3 class="text-wine-700">Regional Style Variations</h3>

<p>Prosecco DOC from the plains typically exhibits straightforward apple and pear flavors with moderate complexity. In contrast, Conegliano Valdobbiadene DOCG wines from steep hillsides develop pronounced mineral notes from calcareous soils, enhanced salinity, and more concentrated fruit flavors. Cartizze, the grand cru of Prosecco, produces wines with exceptional elegance and persistent mousse due to its unique microclimate and restricted 107-hectare area.</p>

<h3 class="text-wine-700">Quality Markers and Aging</h3>

<p>Superior Prosecco displays fine, persistent perlage, balanced residual sugar (typically 6-12 g/L for Extra Dry), and integrated acidity. <strong>Quality indicators</strong> include complexity beyond simple fruit flavors, mineral undertones, and a creamy mousse texture indicating proper riddling and disgorgement timing.</p>

<p>Unlike vintage Champagne, Prosecco is designed for immediate consumption within 2-3 years of production. While premium examples from Valdobbiadene can develop honeyed notes and deeper complexity over 4-5 years, the grape's appeal lies in its vibrant freshness rather than aged character.</p>

<h2>What Does Prosecco Taste Like?</h2>

<h3>Appearance and Structure</h3>
<p>Quality Prosecco displays a pale straw yellow to light golden hue, with premium examples showing brilliant clarity and fine, persistent bubbles that form elegant chains rising to the surface. The <strong>perlage</strong>—the technical term for bubble quality—serves as your first quality indicator. Superior Proseccos exhibit smaller, more numerous bubbles that dissipate slowly, while lower-tier versions show larger, coarser bubbles that disappear quickly. The wine's viscosity remains light to medium, with a gentle mousse that creates a creamy texture without overwhelming weight.</p>

<h3>Aromatic Profile</h3>
<p>Prosecco's aromatic complexity unfolds in distinct layers. <strong>Primary fruit aromas</strong> dominate, showcasing fresh green apple, ripe pear, and white peach, often accompanied by zesty lemon and lime citrus notes. The signature Glera grape contributes distinctive floral elements—acacia blossom, elderflower, and honeysuckle create an elegant bouquet.</p>

<p><strong>Secondary fermentation aromas</strong> from the Charmat method add subtle bread dough and fresh yeast characteristics, though these remain delicate compared to traditional method sparkling wines. Premium examples may display hints of brioche or cream, indicating extended lees contact during production.</p>

<h3>Palate and Texture</h3>
<p>On the palate, Prosecco delivers bright, refreshing acidity typically ranging from 6-7 g/L, creating that characteristic crisp, clean mouthfeel. The <strong>mousse texture</strong> varies by style: Brut versions offer fine, integrated bubbles, while Frizzante styles present gentler effervescence. Alcohol levels generally sit between 11-12%, contributing to the wine's light, approachable body without heat or heaviness.</p>

<h3>Flavor Development and Finish</h3>
<p>The flavor profile mirrors the aromatics but with added mineral complexity, particularly in DOCG Conegliano Valdobbiadene examples where calcareous soils impart subtle chalky notes. <strong>Fruit flavors intensify mid-palate</strong>—crisp Granny Smith apple, Asian pear, and white peach—while better examples show hints of almond skin and wet stone minerality.</p>

<p>The finish typically runs short to medium in length, ending with clean citrus acidity and a pleasant bitter note reminiscent of lemon pith. <strong>Quality markers</strong> include persistent bubbles, balanced acidity without harshness, and flavor complexity that extends beyond simple fruit. Premium Proseccos demonstrate seamless integration between fruit, acidity, and effervescence, creating an elegant, food-friendly profile that invites the next sip.</p>

<h2>Origins & History</h2>

<p>Prosecco's remarkable journey from a humble northeastern Italian grape to a global sparkling wine phenomenon spans centuries of winemaking evolution. The variety's story begins with <strong>Glera</strong>, the grape's official name since 2009, which has thrived in the Veneto and Friuli regions for over a millennium.</p>

<h3>Ancient Roots and Geographic Origins</h3>

<p>Historical records trace Glera cultivation back to Roman times, when the grape flourished in the hills surrounding modern-day Conegliano and Valdobbiadene. The name "Prosecco" itself derives from the village of Prosecco near Trieste, where this aromatic variety was first documented in the 16th century. Italian ampelographers have confirmed through DNA analysis that Glera is indigenous to northeastern Italy, with genetic markers linking it specifically to the steep, mineral-rich soils of the Treviso province.</p>

<h3>The Charmat Method Revolution</h3>

<p>While Prosecco existed as a still wine for centuries, its transformation into the sparkling wine we know today occurred in the early 1900s. <strong>Federico Martinotti's invention of the tank fermentation method</strong> in 1895, later refined by Eugène Charmat, revolutionized Prosecco production. This technique preserved the grape's delicate floral aromatics—notes of green apple, white peach, and acacia blossom—that would be lost in traditional bottle fermentation.</p>

<h3>Modern Recognition and Global Expansion</h3>

<p>Prosecco's international breakthrough came in the 1960s when Italian producers began marketing it as an elegant, approachable alternative to Champagne. The establishment of <strong>DOCG status for Conegliano Valdobbiadene in 2009</strong> marked a pivotal moment, protecting the most prestigious production zones while distinguishing quality levels.</p>

<p>Today, Prosecco production has expanded beyond Italy's borders, with notable plantings in Australia's King Valley, Brazil's Serra Gaúcha, and Argentina's high-altitude regions. However, <strong>over 90% of global Prosecco still originates from Italy</strong>, where approximately 25,000 hectares of Glera vines produce more than 600 million bottles annually, making it one of the world's most successful sparkling wine categories.</p>

<h2>Grape Characteristics & Winemaking</h2>

<p>Glera, the primary grape behind Prosecco, is a vigorous, high-yielding variety that thrives in the cool, hillside vineyards of Veneto and Friuli-Venezia Giulia. This naturally productive grape requires careful canopy management to maintain quality, with yields legally capped at 13.5 tons per hectare in DOCG zones and 18 tons in DOC areas. The grape's thin skins and tight clusters make it susceptible to botrytis, demanding meticulous vineyard timing and selective harvesting, typically occurring in early to mid-September when acids remain crisp and sugars reach 9.5-10.5% potential alcohol.</p>

<h3 class="text-wine-700">Fermentation Philosophy</h3>

<p>Prosecco's signature freshness stems from the <strong>Charmat method</strong> (Metodo Martinotti), where secondary fermentation occurs in temperature-controlled stainless steel tanks rather than individual bottles. This technique preserves Glera's delicate floral aromatics—particularly white flowers, green apple, and citrus zest—while maintaining the grape's characteristic minerality. Primary fermentation typically occurs at 16-18°C over 15-20 days, followed by secondary fermentation at 12-14°C for 30-40 days. Malolactic fermentation is deliberately avoided to preserve the wine's vibrant acidity, which ranges from 6-7 g/L tartaric acid equivalent.</p>

<h3 class="text-wine-700">Regional Expression</h3>

<p>Glera's terroir sensitivity becomes evident across Prosecco's hierarchy. In the prestigious <strong>Conegliano Valdobbiadene DOCG</strong>, steep slopes with calcareous-clay soils and significant diurnal temperature variation produce wines with intense minerality, complex white fruit flavors, and remarkable longevity. The subzone of Cartizze, with its unique microclimate and ancient marine sediments, yields Proseccos of extraordinary finesse and concentration. In contrast, the broader Prosecco DOC encompasses flatter vineyard sites that produce approachable, fruit-forward wines with softer acidity and broader appeal.</p>

<h3 class="text-wine-700">Quality Markers</h3>

<p>Superior Proseccos exhibit several telltale characteristics: a persistent, fine mousse with pinpoint bubbles indicating proper secondary fermentation; aromatic complexity beyond simple fruit, including honey, almond blossom, and subtle herb notes; and a long, mineral-driven finish that reflects true terroir expression. The best examples show <strong>textural depth</strong> from extended lees contact and demonstrate the grape's ability to balance richness with refreshing acidity.</p>

<h3 class="text-wine-700">Evolution and Aging</h3>

<p>While designed for immediate consumption, quality Proseccos can evolve beautifully for 2-4 years. Base wines from top producers develop honeyed complexity, toasted bread notes, and deeper fruit concentration while maintaining their essential vivacity. Vintage-dated Proseccos from exceptional years, particularly from Conegliano Valdobbiadene's premier sites, can age gracefully for up to six years, developing nuanced tertiary aromas that showcase Glera's surprising aging potential.</p>

<h2>What Does Prosecco Taste Like?</h2>

<h3>Appearance: Visual Clues to Quality</h3>
<p>Quality Prosecco displays a <strong>pale straw to light gold color</strong>, with the deepest hues typically found in DOCG expressions from Valdobbiadene and Conegliano. The wine should show brilliant clarity with persistent, fine bubbles forming a steady mousse—a visual indicator of proper secondary fermentation. <strong>Coarser, larger bubbles suggest lower quality</strong> or improper handling, while the finest Proseccos exhibit what Italians call "perlage fine," tiny bubbles that rise in elegant chains.</p>

<h3>Aromatics: From Orchard to Glass</h3>
<p>Prosecco's aromatic profile centers on <strong>primary fruit aromatics</strong> that showcase the Glera grape's inherent freshness. Expect vibrant notes of green apple, pear, and white peach, often accompanied by citrus zest—particularly lemon and grapefruit. <strong>Secondary fermentation aromas</strong> contribute subtle bread crust and brioche notes in premium examples, while floral elements like acacia blossom and wisteria add complexity.</p>

<p>Superior Proseccos from hillside vineyards often display <strong>mineral undertones</strong>—limestone and wet stone characteristics derived from the calcareous soils of the Prosecco DOCG zone. These tertiary aromatics distinguish exceptional bottles from everyday expressions.</p>

<h3>Palate: Texture and Structure</h3>
<p>Prosecco typically presents a <strong>light to medium body</strong> with vibrant acidity that creates a refreshing, mouth-watering sensation. The carbonation should feel creamy rather than aggressive, with fine bubbles that enhance rather than overwhelm the fruit flavors. Alcohol levels usually range from 11-12%, providing a subtle warming sensation without heaviness.</p>

<h3>Flavor Profile: The Glera Expression</h3>
<p>On the palate, expect a continuation of the aromatic profile: <strong>crisp green apple and ripe pear dominate</strong>, supported by citrus notes that provide brightness and lift. Premium examples often show subtle almond and honey nuances, while the finest DOCG Proseccos reveal delicate mineral salinity that speaks to their unique terroir.</p>

<h3>Finish and Quality Markers</h3>
<p>Quality Prosecco delivers a <strong>clean, refreshing finish</strong> with lingering fruit and a subtle mineral note. Superior examples maintain their flavor intensity through a medium-length finish, while basic Proseccos tend to fade quickly.</p>

<p><strong>Premium quality indicators include</strong>: persistent fine bubbles, complex aromatics beyond simple fruit, noticeable minerality, and a finish that invites the next sip rather than leaving the palate feeling stripped or overly dry.</p>

  <h2>Expert Tips</h2>
<ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-4 text-gray-700">
  <li><strong>Decode the Denomination Hierarchy</strong> - Prosecco DOCG (Conegliano Valdobbiadene and Asolo) offers superior complexity and minerality compared to basic Prosecco DOC, thanks to steep hillside vineyards with cooler temperatures and limestone-rich soils. Valdobbiadene's chalky marls create wines with pronounced citrus zest and white flower notes, while Asolo's volcanic soils produce more structured bubbles with stone fruit character. Expect to pay 2-3x more for DOCG, but the difference in finesse and aging potential is immediately apparent.</li>

  <li><strong>Master the Sweetness Scale Navigation</strong> - Brut (0-12g/L residual sugar) dominates quality Prosecco production, offering the cleanest expression of Glera's green apple and pear characteristics. Extra Dry (12-17g/L) paradoxically tastes drier than Brut due to higher acidity balancing the sugar, making it ideal for aperitivo hour. Avoid Dry and Demi-Sec unless specifically pairing with desserts - the 17-50g/L sugar masks Prosecco's delicate fruit aromatics.</li>

  <li><strong>Temperature Precision Reveals Quality Differences</strong> - Serve premium DOCG Proseccos at 46-48°F to showcase their mineral complexity and textural finesse, while basic DOC versions shine at 40-42°F where colder temperatures mask any coarse bubbles or simple fruit flavors. High-quality Proseccos maintain their aromatic intensity even as they warm, revealing secondary notes of acacia honey and crushed herbs that inferior bottles cannot sustain.</li>

  <li><strong>Glassware Choice Amplifies Style Differences</strong> - Use tulip-shaped Champagne flutes for DOCG Proseccos to concentrate their delicate white flower and citrus aromatics, while wider-bowled white wine glasses work better for frizzante styles where you want to appreciate the softer, creamier mousse. Avoid narrow flutes for Col Fondo (sur lie) Proseccos - their cloudy, yeasty character needs room to breathe and express rustic complexity.</li>

  <li><strong>Identify Production Method Impact on Bubble Quality</strong> - Charmat method Proseccos (the vast majority) display fresh, fruity bubbles that dissipate quickly, perfect for immediate consumption. Metodo Classico Proseccos (rare but increasing) develop finer, more persistent bubbles with brioche notes from lees contact, but cost significantly more. Col Fondo represents the traditional method with natural sediment, creating softer bubbles and funky, farmhouse-style complexity that polarizes drinkers.</li>

  <li><strong>Age Assessment Changes Everything</strong> - Drink basic Prosecco DOC within 18 months of harvest (check the vintage on back label) when Glera's characteristic green apple and white peach flavors are most vibrant. Quality DOCG bottles can improve for 2-3 years, developing honeyed complexity while maintaining freshness, but avoid any Prosecco over 4 years old unless it's specifically labeled as a riserva intended for aging.</li>

  <li><strong>Producer Reputation Trumps Marketing</strong> - Seek out grower-producers like Nino Franco, Case Bianche, or Adami over large industrial brands for authentic expression of terroir. These smaller producers often make single-vineyard Proseccos that showcase specific hillside sites, offering dramatically more personality than mass-market bottles. Look for "Rive" designation, indicating grapes from specific steep slopes with superior drainage and sun exposure.</li>

  <li><strong>Optimal Drinking Windows Vary by Style</strong> - Open spumante (fully sparkling) Proseccos immediately upon purchase to capture peak effervescence, while frizzante styles (lightly sparkling) can handle brief cellaring and actually benefit from 6-12 months to integrate their gentler bubbles. Col Fondo Proseccos drink beautifully upon release but can evolve interestingly for 18-24 months, developing more pronounced yeasty, sourdough characteristics.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Aging & Cellaring</h2>

<p>Unlike still wines, <strong>Prosecco's aging potential varies dramatically by quality level</strong>, with most styles designed for immediate enjoyment rather than long-term cellaring. Understanding these differences is crucial for maximizing your investment.</p>

<h3>Quality-Based Aging Potential</h3>

<p><strong>Prosecco DOC</strong> should be consumed within 1-2 years of purchase, as the fresh fruit character and vibrant acidity that define these wines quickly diminish. <strong>Prosecco DOCG Conegliano Valdobbiadene</strong> can develop beautifully for 3-5 years, gaining honeyed complexity while retaining its signature mineral backbone. Premium <strong>Cartizze</strong> represents the pinnacle, capable of aging gracefully for 8-10 years, developing notes of brioche, dried fruit, and enhanced textural richness.</p>

<h3>Evolution and Peak Windows</h3>

<p>Young Prosecco showcases bright citrus and green apple flavors with floral aromatics. As it ages, the wine develops <strong>secondary characteristics</strong>: the primary fruit evolves from fresh to dried, acidity softens slightly, and autolytic notes emerge—particularly in wines aged on lees. Vintage Prosecco from top producers like Bisol or Nino Franco hits its peak around year 4-6, when fruit intensity balances perfectly with developed complexity.</p>

<h3>Storage Requirements</h3>

<p>Store Prosecco at <strong>50-55°F with 70% humidity</strong>, keeping bottles horizontal to maintain cork moisture. Unlike Champagne, Prosecco's Charmat method production makes it more sensitive to temperature fluctuations—even brief exposure to heat above 70°F can prematurely age the wine.</p>

<h3>Aging vs. Spoilage</h3>

<p>Properly aged Prosecco develops golden hues and honeyed aromatics while maintaining bright acidity. <strong>Warning signs of spoilage</strong> include brown coloration, flat bubbles that dissipate immediately, and oxidized aromas reminiscent of sherry or bruised apples. When in doubt, younger is almost always better with Prosecco.</p>

    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-wine-700 mb-2">What's the difference between Prosecco DOCG and DOC, and which should I choose?</h3>
    <p class="text-gray-700">Prosecco DOCG comes from two premium zones - Conegliano Valdobbiadene and Asolo - with stricter production rules and hillside vineyards that produce more concentrated, elegant wines. DOC Prosecco covers a much larger area across nine provinces and offers consistent quality at accessible prices. Choose DOCG for special occasions when you want complexity and finesse, or DOC for everyday drinking and cocktails.</p>

    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-wine-700 mb-2">How do Brut, Extra Dry, and Dry Prosecco compare in sweetness levels?</h3>
    <p class="text-gray-700">Despite confusing names, Brut is the driest style with 0-12g/L residual sugar, offering crisp minerality perfect for aperitifs. Extra Dry (12-17g/L) provides a touch of sweetness that balances Prosecco's natural acidity, making it most food-friendly. Dry Prosecco (17-32g/L) is noticeably sweet and pairs beautifully with fruit-based desserts or spicy Asian cuisine.</p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-wine-700 mb-2">Is spending $20+ on premium Prosecco worth it compared to $10 bottles?</h3>
    <p class="text-gray-700">Premium Proseccos from top producers like Bisol, Nino Franco, or Villa Sandi offer significantly more complexity, with secondary fermentation sur lie aging that creates finer bubbles and richer texture. The fruit comes from carefully selected vineyard sites with lower yields, resulting in more concentrated flavors and longer finish. Budget options work well for mixing but lack the elegance and depth that makes premium Prosecco suitable for special occasions or food pairing.</p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-wine-700 mb-2">Should I choose traditional Prosecco or trendy Prosecco rosé for entertaining?</h3>
    <p class="text-gray-700">Traditional Prosecco offers classic green apple and citrus notes with reliable crowd appeal, making it safer for mixed groups. Prosecco rosé, made with 10-15% Pinot Nero, provides strawberry and cherry flavors with beautiful salmon color that photographs well and appeals to rosé wine lovers. Consider rosé for summer gatherings or Instagram-worthy events, but stick with traditional for business entertaining or when serving wine-savvy guests.</p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-wine-700 mb-2">What's the biggest mistake people make when comparing Prosecco options?</h3>
    <p class="text-gray-700">The most common error is assuming all Prosecco tastes the same and choosing solely based on price or attractive packaging. Production method, vineyard location, and residual sugar levels create dramatic differences in flavor profile, bubble quality, and food pairing potential. Always check the label for DOCG vs DOC designation and sweetness level, then consider your intended use - cocktail base, food pairing, or standalone sipping.</p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-wine-700 mb-2">How long can I keep an opened bottle of Prosecco fresh?</h3>
    <p class="text-gray-700">Unlike still wines, Prosecco loses its signature effervescence quickly once opened, staying fresh for only 1-3 days in the refrigerator with a proper sparkling wine stopper. Higher-quality DOCG Proseccos with finer bubbles may retain carbonation slightly longer than DOC versions. For best results, consume within 24 hours or use day-old Prosecco in cooking applications like risotto or poaching fruit.</p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-wine-700 mb-2">Are there good alternatives to Prosecco that offer similar value?</h3>
    <p class="text-gray-700">Franciacorta DOCG provides more complexity through traditional method production but costs 2-3 times more than premium Prosecco. For budget-conscious buyers, Spanish Cava offers traditional method quality at Prosecco DOC prices, while French Crémant provides regional diversity with similar pricing to mid-range Prosecco. However, none match Prosecco's unique combination of fresh fruit character, soft bubbles, and food-friendly acidity at its price point.</p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-wine-700 mb-2">Which Prosecco style works best for beginners who find sparkling wine too acidic?</h3>
    <p class="text-gray-700">Extra Dry Prosecco offers the perfect entry point with 12-17g/L residual sugar that softens the wine's natural acidity while maintaining refreshing character. Look for producers from the warmer Treviso plains rather than steep Valdobbiadene hillsides, as these wines tend to be rounder and more approachable. Avoid Brut styles initially, and consider serving slightly warmer (45-48°F) to reduce perceived acidity.</p>
