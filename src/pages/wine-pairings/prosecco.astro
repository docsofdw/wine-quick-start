  Prosecco wasn't always a household name. Its rise to prominence tells a story of winemakers pushing boundaries and consumers embracing quality.

  <h2>Understanding Prosecco</h2>

  <p>## Comparing Your Options for Prosecco

Not all prosecco is created equal. Understanding the differences helps you make informed choices that match your preferences and occasions.

## Side-by-Side Comparison

| Factor | Option A | Option B | Option C |
|--------|----------|----------|----------|
| **Price Range** | $15-25 | $25-45 | $45+ |
| **Best For** | Everyday | Special Occasions | Celebrations |
| **Complexity** | Approachable | Moderate | Layered |
| **Age Potential** | Drink now | 2-5 years | 5-15 years |
| **Food Pairing** | Versatile | Selective | Rich dishes |

## Weighing the Options
