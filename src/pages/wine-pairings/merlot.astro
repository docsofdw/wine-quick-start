  My first encounter with truly exceptional <a href="/learn/bordeaux-wine-guide" class="internal-link">merlot</a> came unexpectedly at a small restaurant in wine country. The complexity in that glass sparked a lasting appreciation.

  <h2>Understanding Merlot</h2>

  <p>## Understanding Merlot

Merlot represents one of wine's most rewarding areas of exploration. Whether you're just starting out or refining your knowledge, understanding the fundamentals transforms your appreciation.

## Key Characteristics

### What to Look For
When evaluating merlot, experienced tasters focus on:
1. **Aromatic intensity** and purity of fruit
2. **Structural elements** like tannin and acidity
3. **Length and persistence** on the palate
4. **Overall harmony** between components

## Expert Recommendations

Finding quality merlot requires knowing trusted producers and regions. Look for wines with consistent critical acclaim and a track record of quality across vintages.

## Buying Guide

### Where to Shop
**Specialty Wine Shops** offer expertise and curated selections—ideal when you need guidance. **Online Retailers** provide convenience and often better pricing. **Direct from Wineries** gives access to limited releases and library wines.

## Storage & Serving

Proper storage protects your investment. Keep wines at 55°F with 70% humidity, away from light and vibration. Most merlot drinks best within 3-5 years, though premium bottles reward patience.</p>

<h2>Origins & History</h2>

<p>Merlot's story begins in the rolling hills of <strong>Bordeaux, France</strong>, where the grape has been cultivated since at least the 18th century. The variety's name derives from the French word "merle," meaning blackbird, likely referring to either the grape's dark blue-black color or the birds' fondness for the sweet, early-ripening fruit.</p>

<p>DNA analysis conducted in the 1990s revealed Merlot's fascinating parentage: it's a natural cross between <strong>Cabernet Franc and Magdeleine Noire des Charentes</strong>, an obscure grape variety from southwestern France. This discovery explained Merlot's softer tannins compared to its half-sibling Cabernet Sauvignon, which shares the same Cabernet Franc parent.</p>

<p>From its Bordeaux birthplace, Merlot spread throughout France's wine regions, finding particular success in <strong>Saint-Émilion and Pomerol</strong>, where it became the dominant variety in legendary wines like Château Pétrus and Château Le Pin. The grape's ability to ripen earlier than Cabernet Sauvignon made it invaluable in Bordeaux's maritime climate.</p>

<h3>Global Expansion and Modern Recognition</h3>

<p>Merlot's international journey began in earnest during the 19th century, reaching Italy's Veneto region and later spreading to <strong>California, Washington State, and Chile</strong>. The variety gained tremendous popularity in the 1990s, particularly after the release of the documentary "Mondovino" showcased accessible, fruit-forward Merlots that appealed to new wine drinkers.</p>

<p>A pivotal moment came with the emergence of <strong>Washington State's Merlot</strong> in the 1980s, which demonstrated the grape's potential outside of France. However, the variety faced a significant challenge after the 2004 film "Sideways" negatively portrayed Merlot, leading to decreased plantings in some regions.</p>

<p>Today, Merlot ranks as the <strong>world's second-most planted red grape variety</strong>, with over 660,000 acres globally. France leads production with 115,000 acres, followed by Italy, the United States, and Chile. Modern winemakers increasingly focus on expressing Merlot's elegant, terroir-driven characteristics, moving beyond the simple, commercial styles that once dominated the market.</p>

<h2>Grape Characteristics & Winemaking</h2>

<h3>Viticulture and Growing Requirements</h3>
<p>Merlot's viticultural success stems from its adaptability and relatively forgiving nature in the vineyard. The grape demonstrates <strong>moderate to high vigor</strong>, producing generous yields of 4-6 tons per acre when uncontrolled, though premium producers typically restrict yields to 2-3 tons for concentrated fruit. Merlot ripens earlier than Cabernet Sauvignon—typically 1-2 weeks ahead—making it valuable in cooler climates where full ripeness can be challenging. The thin-skinned berries are susceptible to bunch rot in humid conditions, requiring careful canopy management and strategic leaf removal to ensure proper air circulation.</p>

<p>The grape thrives in <strong>clay-dominant soils</strong> that retain moisture, particularly the blue clay of Pomerol or the clay-limestone blends of Saint-Émilion. These soils moderate the vine's natural vigor while providing consistent water availability during the critical ripening period. Cool morning fog followed by warm, sunny afternoons creates ideal ripening conditions, allowing the grape to maintain acidity while developing its characteristic plush fruit character.</p>

<h3>Winemaking Techniques</h3>
<p>Merlot's naturally high sugar content and moderate tannin levels make it relatively straightforward to vinify. <strong>Fermentation temperatures</strong> typically range from 82-86°F (28-30°C), warmer than Pinot Noir but cooler than robust Cabernet Sauvignon to preserve the grape's inherent fruit purity. Extended maceration periods of 15-25 days help extract color and tannins from the thin skins, while gentle cap management prevents over-extraction of harsh compounds.</p>

<p><strong>Malolactic fermentation</strong> is standard practice, converting sharp malic acid to softer lactic acid and contributing to Merlot's characteristic smooth, round mouthfeel. Oak treatment varies significantly: Bordeaux producers favor 225-liter French oak barrels with 20-30% new wood annually, while New World producers might use American oak or stainless steel to emphasize fruit character over wood influence.</p>

<h3>Regional Expression and Quality Indicators</h3>
<p><strong>Right Bank Bordeaux</strong> Merlots showcase mineral complexity with graphite, tobacco, and dried herb nuances alongside dark fruit. <strong>California examples</strong> from Napa Valley emphasize ripe blackberry and chocolate notes with softer tannins, while <strong>Washington State</strong> produces structured versions with bright acidity and herbal undertones. <strong>Chile's Colchagua Valley</strong> delivers fruit-forward styles with distinctive eucalyptus and spice notes.</p>

<p>Premium Merlots exhibit <strong>concentrated dark fruit</strong> balanced by natural acidity, fine-grained tannins, and complex secondary aromas of leather, cedar, and dried herbs. The best examples show restraint—powerful without being heavy, rich without sacrificing elegance.</p>

<h3>Aging Potential</h3>
<p>Quality Merlots evolve beautifully over 10-20 years. Young wines display primary fruit flavors of plum and blackberry, developing <strong>tertiary complexity</strong> of truffle, forest floor, and aged leather with time. The grape's moderate tannin structure allows earlier approachability than Cabernet Sauvignon while maintaining sufficient backbone for extended cellaring.</p>

<h2>What Does Merlot Taste Like?</h2>

<h3>Appearance and Visual Cues</h3>
<p>Merlot displays a spectrum of ruby to garnet hues, with young wines showcasing deep purple-red cores and bright crimson edges. Premium examples often exhibit impressive <strong>color saturation</strong> and moderate viscosity, creating visible "legs" that cling to the glass—a sign of good concentration and moderate alcohol levels (typically 13-15%). As Merlot ages, the color evolves toward brick-orange at the rim, indicating developed tannins and tertiary complexity.</p>

<h3>Aromatic Complexity</h3>
<p>Merlot's aromatic profile unfolds in distinct layers. <strong>Primary fruit aromas</strong> center on dark berries—particularly black cherry, blackberry, and plum—often accompanied by red fruit notes like raspberry in cooler climates. <strong>Secondary fermentation aromas</strong> contribute vanilla, cedar, and sweet spices from oak aging, while malolactic fermentation adds a subtle buttery quality.</p>

<p>In premium, aged examples, <strong>tertiary aromas</strong> develop remarkable complexity: leather, tobacco leaf, dried herbs like thyme and rosemary, forest floor, and subtle chocolate. Right Bank Bordeaux Merlots often show distinctive graphite minerality, while New World versions may display eucalyptus or mint characteristics.</p>

<h3>Palate Structure and Texture</h3>
<p>Merlot typically presents a <strong>medium to full body</strong> with silky, approachable tannins—significantly softer than Cabernet Sauvignon. The wine's moderate acidity (usually 6-7 g/L) provides freshness without sharp edges, creating an inherently food-friendly profile. Quality Merlots show excellent <strong>mid-palate density</strong>, filling the mouth with rich, velvety texture.</p>

<h3>Flavor Profile</h3>
<p>The flavor journey begins with ripe dark fruit—blackberry compote, cherry liqueur, and plum—supported by warming spices like cinnamon, clove, and black pepper. <strong>Terroir expression</strong> varies dramatically: Saint-Émilion Merlots show limestone minerality and floral notes, while Napa Valley examples offer concentrated cassis and chocolate. Cool-climate versions retain bright red fruit and herbal complexity, including bell pepper notes from methoxypyrazines when underripe.</p>

<h3>Finish and Quality Markers</h3>
<p>Premium Merlots deliver a <strong>long, persistent finish</strong> lasting 30+ seconds, with fruit flavors gradually revealing earthy undertones and integrated oak spices. Quality markers include balanced alcohol integration, seamless tannin structure, and the absence of green or vegetal notes. The finest examples show <strong>layered complexity</strong> that continues evolving in the glass, with each sip revealing new nuances—the hallmark of truly exceptional Merlot.</p>

<h2>Origins & History</h2>

<p>Merlot's story begins in the <strong>Bordeaux region of France</strong>, where the grape has been cultivated since at least the 18th century. The variety's name derives from the French word "merle" (blackbird), likely referring to either the grape's dark blue color or the birds' fondness for the sweet, early-ripening fruit. First documented in the commune of Libourne in 1784, Merlot quickly established itself as an essential component in Bordeaux's Right Bank appellations, particularly in <strong>Pomerol and Saint-Émilion</strong>.</p>

<p>DNA analysis conducted in the 1990s revealed Merlot's fascinating parentage: it's a natural cross between <strong>Cabernet Franc and Magdeleine Noire des Charentes</strong>, an obscure variety from southwestern France. This discovery explained Merlot's softer tannins compared to its half-sibling Cabernet Sauvignon, which shares the same Cabernet Franc parent but with Sauvignon Blanc.</p>

<p>The grape's expansion beyond Bordeaux accelerated in the 19th century, spreading throughout France's Languedoc and into Italy's Veneto region. However, Merlot's true international breakthrough came in the <strong>New World during the 1970s and 1980s</strong>. California's Napa Valley and Sonoma County pioneered premium Merlot production, followed by Washington State's Columbia Valley, which proved exceptionally well-suited to the variety.</p>

<p>A pivotal moment arrived with the emergence of <strong>Château Pétrus</strong> in Pomerol as one of the world's most expensive wines, proving Merlot's capability for greatness. Similarly, California's Duckhorn Vineyards, founded in 1978, demonstrated that New World Merlot could achieve critical acclaim and age beautifully.</p>

<p>Today, Merlot ranks as the <strong>second-most planted red grape variety globally</strong>, covering approximately 267,000 hectares. While the variety experienced a temporary decline in popularity following the 2004 film "Sideways," quality-focused producers have maintained strong demand. Key growing regions now include Chile's Colchagua Valley, Australia's Margaret River, South Africa's Stellenbosch, and Italy's Tuscany, where it contributes to prestigious Super Tuscan blends alongside Sangiovese.</p>

<h2>Grape Characteristics & Winemaking</h2>

<h3>Viticulture: The Foundation of Quality</h3>
<p>Merlot's naturally vigorous growth requires careful canopy management to achieve balanced fruit expression. The variety thrives in well-drained clay and limestone soils, which provide the water retention necessary during hot summers while preventing waterlogging. Merlot ripens earlier than Cabernet Sauvignon—typically 1-2 weeks ahead—making harvest timing critical. Optimal picking occurs when phenolic ripeness aligns with sugar accumulation, usually between 22-24° Brix, to preserve the grape's hallmark silky tannins while avoiding jammy overripeness.</p>

<p>Yield management proves essential for quality. While Merlot can produce abundantly (up to 60 hl/ha), the finest examples limit yields to 35-45 hl/ha through green harvesting and strict vine selection. This concentration intensifies flavor compounds like 3-isobutyl-2-methoxypyrazine, which contributes herbaceous notes when balanced properly.</p>

<h3>Winemaking Techniques: Crafting Character</h3>
<p>Merlot's thin skins and moderate tannin levels require gentle extraction techniques. Cold pre-fermentation maceration for 3-5 days enhances color stability and fruit aromatics without extracting harsh tannins. Fermentation typically occurs at 26-28°C in stainless steel or concrete tanks, with pump-overs preferred over punch-downs to avoid over-extraction.</p>

<p><strong>Malolactic fermentation is standard</strong>, converting sharp malic acid to softer lactic acid, which complements Merlot's naturally round profile. Oak treatment varies significantly: while Right Bank Bordeaux employs 30-60% new French oak for 12-18 months, cooler climate producers often use older barrels or larger foudres to preserve fruit purity. Some producers employ steel-only vinification for fresh, fruit-forward styles.</p>

<h3>Regional Expression & Terroir</h3>
<p>Terroir dramatically influences Merlot's personality. <strong>Bordeaux's Right Bank</strong> produces structured, age-worthy wines with dark fruit, tobacco, and earth notes. <strong>California's Napa Valley</strong> yields more opulent expressions with ripe plum and chocolate characteristics. <strong>Washington State</strong> crafts elegant, herb-inflected styles with bright acidity, while <strong>Chile's Colchagua Valley</strong> generates fruit-forward wines with distinctive eucalyptus undertones from its Mediterranean climate.</p>

<h3>Quality Indicators & Aging Potential</h3>
<p>Exceptional Merlot displays seamless integration of fruit, oak, and tannins rather than dominant single elements. Quality indicators include deep, saturated color, complex aromatic layering from fresh fruit to earthy secondary notes, and balanced acidity that provides structure without harsh edges.</p>

<p><strong>Aging potential varies by style and origin.</strong> Premium Bordeaux Merlot can evolve gracefully for 15-25 years, developing tertiary notes of leather, truffle, and dried herbs. New World examples typically peak within 8-12 years, though exceptional vineyard sites can produce wines with decades-long potential. During aging, Merlot's anthocyanins polymerize with tannins, creating the signature brick-red hues and silky mouthfeel that define mature examples.</p>

<h2>What Does Merlot Taste Like?</h2>

<div class="bg-wine-50 p-6 rounded-lg">

<h3>Appearance and Structure</h3>
<p>Merlot displays a spectrum of ruby to garnet hues, with young wines showing vibrant purple edges that evolve into brick-orange tones with age. The wine's <strong>medium to full body</strong> creates noticeable viscosity—those "legs" that cling to the glass indicate higher alcohol content (typically 13.5-15%) and glycerol from ripe fruit extraction. Premium examples exhibit deep color saturation, signaling concentrated phenolic compounds from low-yield vineyards.</p>

<h3>Aromatic Complexity</h3>
<p>Merlot's aromatic profile unfolds in distinct layers. <strong>Primary fruit aromas</strong> center on dark berries—blackberry, black cherry, and plum—often accompanied by red fruit notes like raspberry in cooler climates. <strong>Secondary fermentation aromas</strong> contribute chocolate, vanilla, and sweet spices from oak aging, while malolactic fermentation adds creamy, buttery nuances.</p>

<p>With bottle age, <strong>tertiary aromatics</strong> develop remarkable complexity: leather, tobacco, forest floor, dried herbs, and the distinctive "cedar box" character that defines mature Bordeaux-style Merlots. Right Bank Bordeaux examples often show graphite minerality, while New World versions lean toward eucalyptus and coffee bean notes.</p>

<h3>Palate and Texture</h3>
<p>Merlot's hallmark is its <strong>velvety, approachable texture</strong>. The wine typically shows moderate acidity (3.2-3.6 pH), making it rounder and more immediately pleasurable than Cabernet Sauvignon. Tannins range from soft and integrated in warmer regions to firm and structured in Bordeaux, derived from both grape skins and oak aging.</p>

<p>The <strong>flavor profile</strong> mirrors the aromatics: ripe blackberry and plum dominate, supported by dark chocolate, espresso, and baking spices like cinnamon and clove. Cooler climate expressions reveal herbal notes—bay leaf, thyme—and mineral undertones reflecting limestone or clay soils.</p>

<h3>Finish and Quality Markers</h3>
<p>Premium Merlots display a <strong>long, persistent finish</strong> lasting 30+ seconds, with evolving flavors that reveal new nuances. The aftertaste balances fruit sweetness with savory elements and fine-grained tannins.</p>

<p><strong>Quality indicators</strong> include: seamless integration of oak and fruit, balanced acidity that provides freshness without sharpness, complex mid-palate development, and the ability to improve with 5-15 years of cellaring. Exceptional examples show terroir expression—whether Pomerol's iron-rich clay or Napa's volcanic soils—creating distinctive mineral signatures that elevate the wine beyond simple fruit expression.</p>

  <h2>Expert Tips</h2>
<ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-4 text-gray-700">
  <li><strong>Master the Right Bank Selection</strong> - When choosing premium Merlot, prioritize Bordeaux's Right Bank appellations like Saint-Émilion and Pomerol where Merlot thrives in clay-limestone soils. These wines showcase Merlot's full potential with deeper complexity than Left Bank blends. Look for producers like Château Pétrus or Château Le Pin for benchmark expressions, or seek value in Saint-Émilion Grand Cru from estates like Château Figeac.</li>

  <li><strong>Serve at Precisely 60-65°F for Optimal Expression</strong> - Merlot's silky tannins and fruit-forward nature require cooler serving temperatures than Cabernet Sauvignon. At 60-65°F, the wine's characteristic plum and blackberry notes remain vibrant while the tannins stay supple. Warmer temperatures mask Merlot's elegance and make the alcohol more prominent, while cooler temps mute its generous fruit character.</li>

  <li><strong>Decant Young Merlot for 30-45 Minutes</strong> - Unlike Cabernet Sauvignon which may need hours, young Merlot (under 8 years) benefits from brief 30-45 minute decanting to soften its tannins and integrate oak. Older Right Bank Bordeaux (15+ years) should be decanted just before serving to remove sediment without losing delicate tertiary aromas of leather, truffle, and forest floor.</li>

  <li><strong>Choose Burgundy-Style Glasses for Aromatic Concentration</strong> - Merlot's aromatic complexity shines in glasses with a wider bowl and narrower rim than Bordeaux glasses. The shape concentrates Merlot's signature violet, cocoa, and herb notes while allowing the wine's softer tannin structure to coat the palate evenly. Avoid overly large bowls that dissipate Merlot's more subtle aromatics.</li>

  <li><strong>Understand Merlot's Bipolar Aging Curve</strong> - Quality Merlot shows drinkability within 2-5 years but enters a "dumb phase" around 6-12 years where fruit recedes before tertiary complexity emerges. Top Right Bank wines re-emerge beautifully at 15-25 years with developed leather, tobacco, and mineral notes. Plan purchases accordingly - buy to drink young or cellar for the long term.</li>

  <li><strong>Recognize Clone-Specific Characteristics</strong> - Merlot's three main clones produce distinct profiles: Clone 181 offers structure and aging potential (common in Bordeaux), Clone 314 provides immediate fruit appeal (popular in California), and Clone 1 delivers balanced elegance. Understanding these differences helps predict a wine's style and optimal drinking window.</li>

  <li><strong>Match Food to Merlot's Texture Profile</strong> - Merlot's moderate tannins and higher natural acidity make it ideal for dishes with rich, savory elements rather than heavily charred meats. Think braised short ribs, duck confit, or mushroom risotto. The wine's plush texture complements umami-rich foods, while its acidity cuts through cream-based sauces beautifully.</li>

  <li><strong>Watch for Vintage Variation in Cool Climates</strong> - Merlot ripens earlier than Cabernet but struggles in cool, wet years, producing thin, herbaceous wines. In Bordeaux, avoid challenging vintages like 2013 or 2007 for Right Bank wines. Conversely, warm years like 2009, 2010, and 2016 produce exceptional Merlot with concentrated fruit and silky tannins that showcase the variety at its finest.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Aging & Cellaring</h2>

<p>Merlot's aging potential varies dramatically based on origin and winemaking style. <strong>Premium Bordeaux Right Bank wines</strong> from Pomerol and Saint-Émilion can age gracefully for 15-25 years, with exceptional vintages like 2005 or 2010 developing for decades. Napa Valley reserve Merlots typically peak between 8-15 years, while everyday bottlings are best consumed within 3-5 years of vintage.</p>

<h3>Evolution in the Cellar</h3>

<p>Young Merlot displays primary fruit flavors—blackberry, plum, and cherry—supported by firm tannins. During aging, these <strong>tannins polymerize and soften</strong>, creating a silkier mouthfeel. The fruit transitions from fresh to dried and concentrated, while tertiary aromas emerge: leather, tobacco, forest floor, and truffle. Well-aged Merlot develops remarkable complexity, with the grape's natural coffee and chocolate notes becoming more pronounced.</p>

<h3>Optimal Storage Conditions</h3>

<p>Store Merlot at a consistent <strong>55-58°F (13-14°C)</strong> with 60-70% humidity. Position bottles horizontally to keep corks moist, preventing oxidation. Avoid temperature fluctuations greater than 5°F, which can cause premature aging. Darkness is essential—UV light degrades wine compounds and can create off-flavors.</p>

<h3>Peak Drinking Windows</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Entry-level Merlot:</strong> 1-3 years from vintage</li>
<li><strong>Regional Bordeaux:</strong> 5-12 years</li>
<li><strong>Premium Napa/Sonoma:</strong> 6-15 years</li>
<li><strong>Top Pomerol/Saint-Émilion:</strong> 10-25 years</li>
</ul>

<p>Properly aged Merlot shows integrated tannins, developed aromatics, and balanced acidity. <strong>Warning signs of spoilage</strong> include excessive browning (beyond amber hues), vinegar-like aromas, or musty cork taint. A slight sediment is normal in aged wines—decant carefully to separate the clear wine from deposits.</p>

    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-wine-700 mb-2">What's the difference between Bordeaux Merlot and California Merlot?</h3>
    <p class="text-gray-700">Bordeaux Merlot tends to be more restrained and earthy, with higher acidity and firmer tannins due to cooler climate and limestone-clay soils. California Merlot is typically riper and more fruit-forward, with softer tannins and higher alcohol content from warmer growing conditions. Right Bank Bordeaux Merlots like those from Pomerol and Saint-Émilion show the grape's most elegant expression.</p>

  <div>
    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-wine-700 mb-2">Is Merlot a good wine for beginners to learn about red wine?</h3>
    <p class="text-gray-700">Yes, Merlot is excellent for wine beginners because of its approachable tannin structure and fruit-forward character. The grape's naturally lower tannin levels compared to Cabernet Sauvignon make it less astringent, while its plum and cherry flavors are easily recognizable. Starting with quality examples from Washington State or Bordeaux helps beginners understand how terroir influences the same grape variety.</p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-wine-700 mb-2">How can I identify quality Merlot when shopping?</h3>
    <p class="text-gray-700">Look for Merlots from established regions like Bordeaux's Right Bank, Washington's Columbia Valley, or Tuscany's Bolgheri zone, where the grape thrives. Quality indicators include balanced alcohol levels (13-14.5%), specific vineyard designations, and producers with consistent track records. Avoid Merlots with excessive oak or alcohol above 15%, which often mask the grape's natural elegance and food-friendly character.</p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-wine-700 mb-2">What temperature should I serve Merlot and does it need decanting?</h3>
    <p class="text-gray-700">Serve Merlot at 60-65°F (15-18°C) to showcase its fruit character without muting its aromatics. Young, tannic Merlots benefit from 30-60 minutes of decanting to soften their structure, while older Bordeaux Merlots may only need brief decanting to separate from sediment. Most everyday Merlots can be enjoyed immediately after opening with just a few minutes of breathing time.</p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-wine-700 mb-2">Why does Merlot have a bad reputation, and is it deserved?</h3>
    <p class="text-gray-700">Merlot's reputation suffered from overproduction of bland, mass-market wines in the 1990s, popularized by the movie "Sideways." This industrial approach masked the grape's true potential shown in premium examples from Pomerol's Château Le Pin or Washington's Leonetti Cellar. The reputation is undeserved—quality Merlot offers complexity, ageability, and food versatility that rivals any noble grape variety.</p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-wine-700 mb-2">What wines are similar to Merlot if I want to explore related styles?</h3>
    <p class="text-gray-700">Explore Cabernet Franc for similar herbaceous notes and medium body, or Sangiovese for comparable acidity and food-pairing versatility. Côtes du Rhône blends offer similar approachability with different flavor profiles, while Pinot Noir provides comparable elegance but with lighter body. For Bordeaux-style blends, try Malbec-based wines from Argentina or Carmenère from Chile.</p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-wine-700 mb-2">How long can I age Merlot, and which styles age best?</h3>
    <p class="text-gray-700">Premium Bordeaux Merlots can age 15-25 years, developing tertiary aromas of leather, earth, and dried fruits. Washington State and quality Italian Merlots typically peak at 8-12 years, while everyday bottlings are best consumed within 3-5 years. Right Bank Bordeaux from exceptional vintages like 2005, 2009, and 2010 show the greatest aging potential due to their structure and terroir-driven complexity.</p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-wine-700 mb-2">What are the most common mistakes people make when buying or serving Merlot?</h3>
    <p class="text-gray-700">The biggest mistake is serving Merlot too warm, which emphasizes alcohol over fruit character. Many people also choose overly oaked, high-alcohol versions that mask the grape's natural elegance, or assume all Merlot is the same regardless of origin. Another common error is pairing Merlot with overly spicy foods that clash with its moderate tannin structure instead of complementary dishes like roasted poultry or mushroom-based cuisine.</p>
