**Specialty Wine Shops** offer expertise and curated selections—ideal when you need guidance. **Online Retailers** provide convenience and often better pricing. **Direct from Wineries** gives access to limited releases and library wines.

## Storage & Serving

Proper storage protects your investment. Keep wines at 55°F with 70% humidity, away from light and vibration. Most merlot drinks best within 3-5 years, though premium bottles reward patience.</p>

<h2>Origins & History</h2>

<p>Merlot's journey begins in the <strong>Bordeaux region of France</strong>, where this noble grape variety first emerged in the 18th century. The name "Merlot" derives from the French word "merle," meaning blackbird, likely referencing either the grape's dark blue-black color or the birds' fondness for the ripe fruit. Historical records show Merlot being cultivated in the Libournais district, particularly around Saint-Émilion and Pomerol, as early as the 1780s.</p>

<p>Modern DNA analysis has revealed Merlot's fascinating parentage: it's an offspring of <strong>Cabernet Franc and Magdeleine Noire des Charentes</strong>, making it a half-sibling to Cabernet Sauvignon. This genetic discovery, confirmed in the 1990s, explains Merlot's structural similarities to other Bordeaux varieties while highlighting its unique characteristics.</p>

<p>Merlot's reputation grew steadily throughout the 19th century as <strong>Right Bank Bordeaux châteaux</strong> like Château Pétrus and Château Le Pin demonstrated its potential for producing wines of extraordinary elegance and complexity. The grape's ability to ripen earlier than Cabernet Sauvignon made it invaluable in Bordeaux's sometimes challenging climate.</p>

<p>The variety's global expansion began in earnest during the 20th century. <strong>California's Napa Valley</strong> embraced Merlot in the 1970s, with producers like Duckhorn Vineyards elevating its status. However, the 2004 film "Sideways" temporarily damaged American Merlot's reputation, though quality-focused producers have since restored its standing.</p>

<p>Today, Merlot ranks as the <strong>world's second-most planted wine grape</strong>, with over 660,000 acres globally. France leads plantings, followed by Italy, California, and emerging regions like Chile's Colchagua Valley and Washington State's Columbia Valley. Recent trends show renewed appreciation for <strong>terroir-driven Merlots</strong>, with cooler climate regions like Friuli-Venezia Giulia and Long Island producing acclaimed examples that showcase the grape's versatility beyond its Bordeaux origins.</p>

<p class="bg-wine-50 p-4 rounded-lg">The grape's adaptability to diverse climates and soils has made it a cornerstone variety in both <strong>Old World tradition and New World innovation</strong>.</p>

<h2>Grape Characteristics & Winemaking</h2>

<h3>Viticulture and Growing Requirements</h3>
<p>Merlot's adaptability makes it one of the world's most planted red varieties, though this flexibility can be both blessing and curse. The grape naturally produces vigorous vines with large clusters, requiring careful canopy management to prevent overcropping. <strong>Yields typically range from 3-5 tons per acre for premium wines</strong>, though commercial vineyards may push 6-8 tons with corresponding quality compromises.</p>

<p>Harvest timing proves critical for Merlot's expression. The grape's thin skin makes it vulnerable to rain and rot, particularly in marginal climates. <strong>Optimal harvest occurs when phenolic ripeness aligns with sugar accumulation</strong> – typically 22-25° Brix depending on style goals. In cooler regions like Bordeaux's Right Bank, this balance often requires extended hang time into October, while warmer New World regions may harvest in late August to preserve acidity.</p>

<h3>Winemaking Techniques and Fermentation</h3>
<p>Merlot's moderate tannin structure allows for diverse winemaking approaches. <strong>Cold maceration for 3-5 days before fermentation</strong> helps extract color and aromatic compounds without harsh tannins. Fermentation temperatures typically run 78-86°F, with many producers employing indigenous yeasts to enhance terroir expression.</p>

<p>The grape responds exceptionally well to malolactic fermentation, which softens its natural acidity and adds textural complexity. <strong>Oak treatment varies dramatically by region and price point</strong> – from 18-24 months in new French barriques for premium Bordeaux to partial steel aging for fruit-forward styles. American oak, while less traditional, can complement New World expressions with vanilla and coconut notes.</p>

<h3>Regional Expression and Terroir</h3>
<p>Merlot's chameleon-like nature produces distinctly different wines across regions. <strong>Bordeaux's clay-limestone soils</strong> yield structured wines with cassis, plum, and mineral notes, while Napa Valley's volcanic soils create opulent examples showing chocolate and espresso character. Cool-climate expressions from places like Carneros emphasize bright red fruit and herbaceous complexity, contrasting with the jammy intensity found in Columbia Valley or McLaren Vale.</p>

<h3>Quality Indicators and Aging Potential</h3>
<p><strong>Superior Merlot displays several key characteristics</strong>: concentrated dark fruit without overripeness, integrated tannins that provide structure without astringency, and aromatic complexity beyond simple fruit flavors. The best examples show distinctive terroir markers – whether Pomerol's truffle earthiness or St-Émilion's limestone minerality.</p>

<p>Premium Merlot typically peaks between 8-15 years, though exceptional vintages from top producers can age gracefully for decades. <strong>Proper cellaring reveals the grape's evolution</strong> from primary fruit to complex secondary flavors of leather, tobacco, and forest floor, while maintaining its characteristic silky texture that distinguishes great Merlot from other Bordeaux varieties.</p>

<h2>What Does Merlot Taste Like?</h2>

<div class="bg-wine-50 p-6 rounded-lg mb-6">

<h3 class="text-wine-700 mb-4">Appearance and Visual Cues</h3>

<p>Merlot displays a spectrum from deep ruby-garnet in youth to brick-tinged mahogany with age. Young Merlots from warm climates like Napa Valley exhibit an almost opaque purple-black core, indicating concentrated anthocyanins (color compounds). The wine's viscosity—visible as "legs" running down the glass—reflects its typically generous alcohol content of 13.5-15%, with premium examples showing excellent clarity and brilliance that speaks to careful winemaking.</p>

<h3 class="text-wine-700 mb-4">Aromatic Complexity</h3>

<p>Merlot's aromatic profile unfolds in distinct layers. <strong>Primary fruit aromas</strong> center on dark berries—blackberry, black cherry, and plum—with warmer climates producing jammy, concentrated notes while cooler regions yield more restrained red fruit character. <strong>Secondary fermentation aromas</strong> contribute chocolate, coffee, and subtle vanilla from oak aging, particularly in Bordeaux-style expressions. <strong>Tertiary aging bouquet</strong> in mature bottles reveals leather, tobacco leaf, dried herbs, and forest floor earthiness—hallmarks of Pomerol's legendary Merlot-based wines.</p>

<h3 class="text-wine-700 mb-4">Palate Structure and Mouthfeel</h3>

<p>Merlot's defining characteristic is its supple, velvety texture created by naturally lower tannin levels compared to Cabernet Sauvignon. The wine typically presents medium to full body with moderate acidity (6.0-6.5 pH), creating an approachable, rounded mouthfeel. Premium examples balance this softness with sufficient structure—think Château Pétrus's silky yet age-worthy profile.</p>

<h3 class="text-wine-700 mb-4">Flavor Journey</h3>

<p>On the palate, Merlot delivers rich dark fruit flavors—blackberry compote, cherry liqueur, and dark plum—supported by warming spices like cinnamon, clove, and black pepper. Terroir-driven examples show distinct mineral qualities: graphite and wet stone from Right Bank Bordeaux, or dusty earth from Washington State. Oak integration adds layers of vanilla, cedar, and subtle smoke without overwhelming the fruit.</p>

<h3 class="text-wine-700 mb-4">Finish and Quality Indicators</h3>

<p>Quality Merlots exhibit a long, satisfying finish lasting 30+ seconds, with flavors evolving from fruit to spice to earthy complexity. <strong>Premium markers</strong> include seamless oak integration, persistent aromatics that develop in the glass, balanced alcohol despite ripeness, and the ability to improve with 5-15 years of cellaring. The finish should feel complete and harmonious, never showing harsh tannins or alcohol heat.</p>

</div>

<h2>Origins & History</h2>

<p>Merlot's story begins in the <strong>Bordeaux region of France</strong>, where the grape has been cultivated since at least the 18th century. The variety's name derives from the French word "merle" (blackbird), likely referring to either the grape's dark blue color or the birds' fondness for the sweet, early-ripening fruit. First documented in the commune of Libourne in 1784, Merlot quickly established itself as an essential component in Bordeaux's Right Bank appellations, particularly in <strong>Pomerol and Saint-Émilion</strong>.</p>

<p>DNA analysis conducted in the 1990s revealed Merlot's fascinating parentage: it's a natural cross between <strong>Cabernet Franc and Magdeleine Noire des Charentes</strong>, an obscure variety from southwestern France. This discovery explained Merlot's softer tannins compared to its half-sibling Cabernet Sauvignon, which shares the same Cabernet Franc parent but with Sauvignon Blanc.</p>

<p>The grape's expansion beyond Bordeaux accelerated in the 19th century, spreading throughout France's Languedoc and into Italy's Veneto region. However, Merlot's true international breakthrough came in the <strong>New World during the 1970s and 1980s</strong>. California's Napa Valley and Sonoma County pioneered premium Merlot production, followed by Washington State's Columbia Valley, which proved exceptionally well-suited to the variety.</p>

<p>A pivotal moment arrived with the emergence of <strong>Château Pétrus</strong> in Pomerol as one of the world's most expensive wines, proving Merlot's capability for greatness. Similarly, California's Duckhorn Vineyards, founded in 1978, demonstrated that New World Merlot could achieve critical acclaim and age beautifully.</p>

<p>Today, Merlot ranks as the <strong>second-most planted red grape variety globally</strong>, covering approximately 267,000 hectares. While the variety experienced a temporary decline in popularity following the 2004 film "Sideways," quality-focused producers have maintained strong demand. Key growing regions now include Chile's Colchagua Valley, Australia's Margaret River, South Africa's Stellenbosch, and Italy's Tuscany, where it contributes to prestigious Super Tuscan blends alongside Sangiovese.</p>

<h2>Grape Characteristics & Winemaking</h2>

<h3>Viticulture: The Foundation of Quality</h3>
<p>Merlot's naturally vigorous growth requires careful canopy management to achieve balanced fruit expression. The variety thrives in well-drained clay and limestone soils, which provide the water retention necessary during hot summers while preventing waterlogging. Merlot ripens earlier than Cabernet Sauvignon—typically 1-2 weeks ahead—making harvest timing critical. Optimal picking occurs when phenolic ripeness aligns with sugar accumulation, usually between 22-24° Brix, to preserve the grape's hallmark silky tannins while avoiding jammy overripeness.</p>

<p>Yield management proves essential for quality. While Merlot can produce abundantly (up to 60 hl/ha), the finest examples limit yields to 35-45 hl/ha through green harvesting and strict vine selection. This concentration intensifies flavor compounds like 3-isobutyl-2-methoxypyrazine, which contributes herbaceous notes when balanced properly.</p>

<h3>Winemaking Techniques: Crafting Character</h3>
<p>Merlot's thin skins and moderate tannin levels require gentle extraction techniques. Cold pre-fermentation maceration for 3-5 days enhances color stability and fruit aromatics without extracting harsh tannins. Fermentation typically occurs at 26-28°C in stainless steel or concrete tanks, with pump-overs preferred over punch-downs to avoid over-extraction.</p>

<p><strong>Malolactic fermentation is standard</strong>, converting sharp malic acid to softer lactic acid, which complements Merlot's naturally round profile. Oak treatment varies significantly: while Right Bank Bordeaux employs 30-60% new French oak for 12-18 months, cooler climate producers often use older barrels or larger foudres to preserve fruit purity. Some producers employ steel-only vinification for fresh, fruit-forward styles.</p>

<h3>Regional Expression & Terroir</h3>
<p>Terroir dramatically influences Merlot's personality. <strong>Bordeaux's Right Bank</strong> produces structured, age-worthy wines with dark fruit, tobacco, and earth notes. <strong>California's Napa Valley</strong> yields more opulent expressions with ripe plum and chocolate characteristics. <strong>Washington State</strong> crafts elegant, herb-inflected styles with bright acidity, while <strong>Chile's Colchagua Valley</strong> generates fruit-forward wines with distinctive eucalyptus undertones from its Mediterranean climate.</p>

<h3>Quality Indicators & Aging Potential</h3>
<p>Exceptional Merlot displays seamless integration of fruit, oak, and tannins rather than dominant single elements. Quality indicators include deep, saturated color, complex aromatic layering from fresh fruit to earthy secondary notes, and balanced acidity that provides structure without harsh edges.</p>

<p><strong>Aging potential varies by style and origin.</strong> Premium Bordeaux Merlot can evolve gracefully for 15-25 years, developing tertiary notes of leather, truffle, and dried herbs. New World examples typically peak within 8-12 years, though exceptional vineyard sites can produce wines with decades-long potential. During aging, Merlot's anthocyanins polymerize with tannins, creating the signature brick-red hues and silky mouthfeel that define mature examples.</p>

<h2>What Does Merlot Taste Like?</h2>

<div class="bg-wine-50 p-6 rounded-lg">

<h3>Appearance and Structure</h3>
<p>Merlot displays a spectrum of ruby to garnet hues, with young wines showing vibrant purple edges that evolve into brick-orange tones with age. The wine's <strong>medium to full body</strong> creates noticeable viscosity—those "legs" that cling to the glass indicate higher alcohol content (typically 13.5-15%) and glycerol from ripe fruit extraction. Premium examples exhibit deep color saturation, signaling concentrated phenolic compounds from low-yield vineyards.</p>

<h3>Aromatic Complexity</h3>
<p>Merlot's aromatic profile unfolds in distinct layers. <strong>Primary fruit aromas</strong> center on dark berries—blackberry, black cherry, and plum—often accompanied by red fruit notes like raspberry in cooler climates. <strong>Secondary fermentation aromas</strong> contribute chocolate, vanilla, and sweet spices from oak aging, while malolactic fermentation adds creamy, buttery nuances.</p>

<p>With bottle age, <strong>tertiary aromatics</strong> develop remarkable complexity: leather, tobacco, forest floor, dried herbs, and the distinctive "cedar box" character that defines mature Bordeaux-style Merlots. Right Bank Bordeaux examples often show graphite minerality, while New World versions lean toward eucalyptus and coffee bean notes.</p>

<h3>Palate and Texture</h3>
<p>Merlot's hallmark is its <strong>velvety, approachable texture</strong>. The wine typically shows moderate acidity (3.2-3.6 pH), making it rounder and more immediately pleasurable than Cabernet Sauvignon. Tannins range from soft and integrated in warmer regions to firm and structured in Bordeaux, derived from both grape skins and oak aging.</p>

<p>The <strong>flavor profile</strong> mirrors the aromatics: ripe blackberry and plum dominate, supported by dark chocolate, espresso, and baking spices like cinnamon and clove. Cooler climate expressions reveal herbal notes—bay leaf, thyme—and mineral undertones reflecting limestone or clay soils.</p>

<h3>Finish and Quality Markers</h3>
<p>Premium Merlots display a <strong>long, persistent finish</strong> lasting 30+ seconds, with evolving flavors that reveal new nuances. The aftertaste balances fruit sweetness with savory elements and fine-grained tannins.</p>

<p><strong>Quality indicators</strong> include: seamless integration of oak and fruit, balanced acidity that provides freshness without sharpness, complex mid-palate development, and the ability to improve with 5-15 years of cellaring. Exceptional examples show terroir expression—whether Pomerol's iron-rich clay or Napa's volcanic soils—creating distinctive mineral signatures that elevate the wine beyond simple fruit expression.</p>

  <h2>Expert Tips</h2>
<ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-4 text-gray-700">
  <li><strong>Master the Right Bank Temperature Sweet Spot</strong> - Serve Merlot at 60-65°F (15-18°C), slightly cooler than Cabernet Sauvignon. This temperature preserves Merlot's signature silky tannins while allowing its plush fruit flavors to shine. Right Bank Bordeaux producers like Château Pétrus specifically recommend this range to showcase Merlot's natural elegance without masking its subtle clay-soil minerality.</li>

  <li><strong>Decant Based on Age and Structure, Not Tradition</strong> - Young, structured Merlots from Napa Valley or Pomerol benefit from 30-60 minutes of decanting to soften tannins and integrate oak. However, mature Merlots (10+ years) with delicate aromatics should only be decanted 15-20 minutes before serving, as their evolved bouquet can dissipate quickly. Washington State Merlots typically need minimal decanting due to their naturally approachable tannin structure.</li>

  <li><strong>Choose Burgundy Bowls Over Bordeaux Glasses</strong> - Despite Merlot's Bordeaux origins, use a wider Burgundy-style bowl to concentrate its generous fruit aromatics. Merlot's lower tannin levels and higher alcohol content benefit from the increased surface area, which enhances the perception of its characteristic plum, chocolate, and herb notes while preventing the alcohol from overwhelming the palate.</li>

  <li><strong>Read the Vintage Climate for Peak Drinking Windows</strong> - Cool vintages produce Merlots with higher acidity and tighter structure (drink 8-15 years), while warm vintages create approachable wines with forward fruit (drink 3-8 years). For example, 2010 Right Bank Bordeaux shows classic cool-vintage structure, while 2009 offers immediate pleasure. Check vintage charts specific to your region of interest.</li>

  <li><strong>Identify Single-Vineyard vs. Blend Styles</strong> - Single-vineyard Merlots showcase terroir-driven characteristics: clay soils produce rich, concentrated wines (Pomerol), while limestone creates more mineral, age-worthy expressions (Saint-Émilion). Blended Merlots often incorporate 10-20% Cabernet Franc or Cabernet Sauvignon for structure, creating different aging trajectories and flavor profiles.</li>

  <li><strong>Store Based on Closure Type and Structure</strong> - Merlots under natural cork can age 15-20 years in proper cellar conditions (55°F, 70% humidity), developing tertiary notes of leather, tobacco, and forest floor. Screwcap Merlots maintain fruit purity but rarely develop complex aging characteristics beyond 5-7 years. High-tannin examples from Washington's Red Mountain AVA are exceptions, aging gracefully for 10+ years even under screwcap.</li>

  <li><strong>Match Food Intensity to Merlot Structure</strong> - Light-bodied Merlots from cooler climates pair with roasted poultry and mushroom dishes, while full-bodied examples from warm regions complement braised short ribs and aged cheeses. The key is matching the wine's tannin level and body weight—never let the food overpower Merlot's inherently elegant character.</li>

  <li><strong>Recognize Regional Peak Drinking Indicators</strong> - Bordeaux Right Bank Merlots show readiness when primary fruit evolves to dried cherry and cedar notes. California Merlots peak when chocolate and vanilla integrate seamlessly. Washington Merlots are ready when herbaceous notes mellow into savory complexity. Trust your palate, but these markers indicate optimal drinking windows for maximum enjoyment.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Aging & Cellaring</h2>

<p>Merlot's aging potential varies dramatically based on quality, terroir, and winemaking style. Understanding these differences is crucial for proper cellaring decisions.</p>

<h3>Aging Potential by Quality Level</h3>
<p>Premium Right Bank Bordeaux from estates like Château Pétrus or Le Pin can age gracefully for <strong>20-40 years</strong>, developing extraordinary complexity. High-quality Napa Valley Merlots typically peak between <strong>8-15 years</strong>, while well-made Washington State examples show their best from <strong>5-12 years</strong>. Entry-level Merlots are best consumed within <strong>2-5 years</strong> of vintage.</p>

<h3>Evolution Over Time</h3>
<p>Young Merlot displays vibrant plum and blackberry fruit with firm tannins. As it ages, the tannins soften and integrate, while primary fruit evolves into complex secondary notes of <strong>leather, tobacco, truffle, and cedar</strong>. The wine's texture becomes silky and seamless, with tertiary aromas of dried herbs and forest floor emerging after a decade or more.</p>

<h3>Storage Requirements</h3>
<p>Maintain consistent temperature between <strong>55-60°F (13-15°C)</strong> with 70% humidity to prevent cork drying. Store bottles horizontally in a dark environment, away from vibration. Merlot's relatively supple tannin structure makes it more sensitive to temperature fluctuations than Cabernet Sauvignon.</p>

<h3>Peak Drinking Windows</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Everyday Merlot:</strong> 1-3 years post-release</li>
<li><strong>Premium regional:</strong> 3-8 years</li>
<li><strong>Top Bordeaux:</strong> 10-25 years</li>
<li><strong>Exceptional vintages:</strong> 15-30+ years</li>
</ul>

<h3>Signs of Proper Development</h3>
<p>Well-aged Merlot shows <strong>brick-red color evolution</strong> at the rim, integrated tannins, and complex aromatics. Warning signs of decline include excessive browning, vinegar-like aromas, or complete fruit loss. Trust your palate—properly stored Merlot should maintain elegance and balance even as it transforms.</p>

<div class="space-y-6">
  <div>
    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-wine-700 mb-2">What's the difference between Right Bank and Left Bank Merlot?</h3>
    <p class="text-gray-700">Right Bank Bordeaux Merlots (from Saint-Émilion and Pomerol) are typically more fruit-forward and approachable, with clay-limestone soils that favor Merlot cultivation. Left Bank Merlots are primarily used as blending components with Cabernet Sauvignon, resulting in more structured, tannic wines from the gravelly soils of Médoc and Haut-Médoc.</p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-wine-700 mb-2">How can I tell if a Merlot is high quality without tasting it?</h3>
    <p class="text-gray-700">Look for specific vineyard designations rather than generic regional appellations, and check for vintage dates (avoid non-vintage bulk wines). Quality Merlots often display deeper, more saturated color in the glass and should have minimal sediment except in aged bottles. Price isn't always indicative, but wines under $8 are typically mass-produced commercial styles.</p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-wine-700 mb-2">Should I decant Merlot, and if so, for how long?</h3>
    <p class="text-gray-700">Young, tannic Merlots (especially those from Bordeaux or premium California producers) benefit from 30-60 minutes of decanting to soften tannins and open aromatics. Older Merlots (10+ years) should be decanted just before serving to separate sediment but avoid prolonged air exposure. Lighter, fruit-forward Merlots can be served directly from the bottle.</p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-wine-700 mb-2">What temperature should I serve Merlot at?</h3>
    <p class="text-gray-700">Serve Merlot at 60-65°F (15-18°C), which is slightly cooler than room temperature. This temperature range allows the fruit characteristics to shine while preventing alcohol from dominating. If your wine has been stored in a warm area, chill it in the refrigerator for 15-20 minutes before serving.</p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-wine-700 mb-2">Why does some Merlot taste thin and jammy while others are rich and complex?</h3>
    <p class="text-gray-700">Thin, jammy Merlots typically result from high-yield farming, warm climates, and industrial winemaking focused on immediate accessibility. Complex Merlots come from lower-yield vines, careful site selection with proper drainage, and winemaking techniques like extended maceration and judicious oak aging. The grape's natural tendency toward high sugar and low acidity makes it particularly susceptible to over-manipulation.</p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-wine-700 mb-2">What are the best value regions for quality Merlot?</h3>
    <p class="text-gray-700">Washington State's Columbia Valley consistently produces excellent Merlots at reasonable prices, offering Bordeaux-like structure without the premium. Chile's Colchagua and Maipo Valleys provide exceptional value, while Southern France's Languedoc region offers serious, food-friendly Merlots. Avoid generic "California" appellations in favor of specific AVAs like Paso Robles or Santa Barbara County for better quality-to-price ratios.</p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-wine-700 mb-2">If I like Merlot, what other wines should I try?</h3>
    <p class="text-gray-700">Merlot lovers should explore Carménère from Chile, which offers similar plushness with more herbaceous complexity, and Malbec from Argentina for comparable fruit-forward richness with different spice notes. Côtes du Rhône blends and Sangiovese-based wines from Tuscany provide similar medium-body profiles with food-friendly acidity. For a step up in intensity, try Cabernet Franc from Loire Valley or Right Bank Bordeaux blends.</p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-wine-700 mb-2">What's the biggest mistake people make when buying Merlot?</h3>
    <p class="text-gray-700">The most common mistake is assuming all Merlots are the same soft, simple style popularized in the 1990s and avoiding the grape entirely based on this misconception. Many wine drinkers also choose based solely on price point without considering the producer's reputation or the specific vineyard site. Quality Merlot requires the same attention to terroir and winemaking as any noble variety.</p>
