  <p><strong>Quick Answer:</strong> Natural wines are made with minimal intervention - no added sulfites, native yeasts, and organic farming. They offer unique flavors but can be unpredictable. Start with established producers for the best introduction.</p>

  <h2>What is Natural Wine?</h2>

  <p>Natural wine represents a philosophy of minimal intervention winemaking, where grapes are farmed organically or biodynamically and fermented with native yeasts with little to no additives.</p>

  <h3>Key Characteristics</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>**Organic or biodynamic farming**</li>
    <li>**Native yeast fermentation**</li>
    <li>**Minimal or no sulfites added**</li>
    <li>**No fining or filtration**</li>
    <li>**Sometimes cloudy appearance**</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Natural Wine Production</h2>

  <h3>In the Vineyard</h3>
  <p>Natural wine begins with healthy grapes. Producers avoid synthetic pesticides, herbicides, and fertilizers, often embracing biodynamic principles that view the vineyard as a living ecosystem.</p>

  <h3>In the Winery</h3>
  <p>Minimal intervention means allowing natural processes to guide winemaking. This includes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Spontaneous fermentation with wild yeasts</li>
    <li>No or minimal sulfur dioxide additions</li>
    <li>Avoiding industrial additives and processing aids</li>
    <li>Sometimes aging in neutral vessels like concrete or old wood</li>
  </ul>
