  <h2>Comparing Your Options for Natural wine</h2>

  <p>Choosing the right natural wine depends on context. Here's how the main options stack up against each other.</p>

  <h2>Side-by-Side Comparison</h2>

  <p>| Factor | Option A | Option B | Option C |</p>

  <p>|--------|----------|----------|----------|</p>

  <p>| **Price Range** | $15-25 | $25-45 | $45+ |</p>

  <p>| **Best For** | Everyday | Special Occasions | Celebrations |</p>

  <p>| **Complexity** | Approachable | Moderate | Layered |</p>

  <p>| **Age Potential** | Drink now | 2-5 years | 5-15 years |</p>

  <p>| **Food Pairing** | Versatile | Selective | Rich dishes |</p>

  <h2>Weighing the Options</h2>

  <h3>Budget-Friendly Approach</h3>

  <p>✅ Accessible and low-risk</p>

  <p>✅ Great for experimentation</p>

  <p>❌ Less complexity and depth</p>

  <p>❌ Limited aging potential</p>

  <h3>Mid-Range Investment</h3>

  <p>✅ Best quality-to-price ratio</p>

  <p>✅ Suitable for most occasions</p>

  <p>❌ Requires some knowledge</p>

  <p>❌ Not for long-term cellaring</p>

  <h3>Premium Selection</h3>

  <p>✅ Exceptional quality and depth</p>

  <p>✅ Cellar-worthy</p>

  <p>❌ Higher financial commitment</p>
