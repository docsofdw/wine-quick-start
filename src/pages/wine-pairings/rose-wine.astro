<h2>Origins & History</h2>

<p>Rosé wine's origins stretch back to antiquity, making it arguably the world's oldest style of wine. The technique emerged naturally in ancient civilizations around the Mediterranean, where winemakers discovered that brief contact between red grape skins and juice created wines with delicate pink hues and refreshing character.</p>

<h3>Ancient Beginnings</h3>

<p>Archaeological evidence suggests that rosé production began over <strong>2,600 years ago</strong> in ancient Greece and Phoenicia. The Greeks called these wines "oinos" and prized their elegant, food-friendly nature. Roman vintners later refined the techniques, with Pliny the Elder documenting early rosé methods in his writings around 77 AD.</p>

<p>The term "rosé" itself derives from the French word for "pink," though historical names varied dramatically. In Provence—considered rosé's spiritual homeland—the style was called "vin d'une nuit" (wine of one night), referring to the brief maceration period that gives rosé its characteristic color.</p>

<h3>Regional Evolution</h3>

<p>Provence established itself as rosé's epicenter during the 14th century, when Pope Clement V moved the papal court to Avignon. The papal preference for local pink wines elevated rosé's status throughout Europe. By the 18th century, <strong>Château d'Esclans</strong> and other Provençal estates were crafting sophisticated rosés that commanded premium prices.</p>

<p>The style spread throughout wine regions via trade routes and cultural exchange. Spanish rosado traditions developed independently in Navarra and Rioja, while Portuguese rosé emerged in the Douro Valley. New World regions embraced rosé during the 20th century, with California, Australia, and South Africa developing distinctive regional expressions.</p>

<h3>Modern Renaissance</h3>

<p>Rosé experienced a remarkable renaissance beginning in the early 2000s. Global consumption increased by <strong>over 30%</strong> between 2002 and 2019, driven by improved quality standards and changing consumer preferences. Today, France remains the largest producer with 7.5 million hectoliters annually, followed by Spain, Italy, and the United States. The "Provence style"—dry, pale, and mineral-driven—has become the global benchmark, influencing production techniques worldwide and cementing rosé's position as a serious wine category deserving of critical acclaim.</p>

<h2>Grape Characteristics & Winemaking</h2>

<h3>Viticulture Fundamentals</h3>
<p>Rosé production begins with careful grape selection and timing. Unlike red wines that require full phenolic ripeness, rosé grapes are often harvested 1-2 weeks earlier to preserve <strong>natural acidity and delicate fruit flavors</strong>. Pinot Noir, for instance, reaches optimal rosé harvest at 19-21 Brix in Provence, while Grenache may be picked at 20-22 Brix to maintain its characteristic bright strawberry notes.</p>

<p>Vineyard management focuses on <strong>controlling yields and canopy exposure</strong>. Premier rosé estates like Domaine Ott in Provence limit yields to 35-45 hectoliters per hectare, concentrating flavors while preserving elegance. Partial shading of grape clusters prevents over-extraction of color compounds, ensuring the pale salmon hues that define premium rosé.</p>

<h3>Winemaking Techniques</h3>
<p>Three primary methods dominate rosé production: <strong>direct pressing, saignée, and blending</strong>. Direct pressing, preferred for premium rosés, involves immediately pressing whole red grapes to extract minimal color. The saignée method "bleeds off" juice from red wine tanks after brief skin contact, creating more structured, food-friendly rosés with 6-24 hours of maceration.</p>

<p>Fermentation typically occurs in <strong>temperature-controlled stainless steel tanks at 55-65°F</strong>, preserving volatile aromatics like isoamyl acetate (banana notes) and ethyl butyrate (tropical fruit). While most rosés avoid oak to maintain freshness, premium examples from Bandol may see brief neutral barrel aging to add textural complexity without overpowering delicate fruit.</p>

<p>Malolactic fermentation remains contentious—<strong>blocked in most cases to preserve crisp acidity</strong>, but partially encouraged in warmer climates like Tavel to soften harsh malic acid and add creamy mouthfeel.</p>

<h3>Regional Expression</h3>
<p><strong>Provençal rosés showcase mineral-driven elegance</strong> with limestone soil imparting chalky texture and garrigue herb notes. Sancerre rosé from Loire Valley expresses bright red currant and white pepper from Pinot Noir on kimmeridgian clay. Spanish Garnacha rosés from Campo de Borja display fuller body and cherry-watermelon flavors from continental climate and schist soils.</p>

<h3>Quality Indicators & Aging</h3>
<p>Premium rosé exhibits <strong>clarity, balance, and persistence</strong>. Look for wines with natural acidity above 6 g/L, alcohol between 11.5-13.5%, and clean, mineral-driven finishes lasting 30+ seconds. Color should be consistent—pale salmon or onionskin—without browning or excessive saturation.</p>

<p>While most rosés peak within 18 months, <strong>exceptional examples age gracefully for 3-5 years</strong>. Provence's Clos Cibonne develops honeyed complexity, while Champagne rosés gain brioche and dried fruit nuances after extended lees contact, proving rosé's potential for serious cellar evolution.</p>

<h2>What Does Rosé Wine Taste Like?</h2>

<div class="bg-wine-50 p-6 rounded-lg">

<h3 class="text-wine-700 mb-3">Appearance and Visual Cues</h3>
<p>Rosé wines display a stunning spectrum of pink hues, from the palest salmon blush of Provence styles to the deeper coral and watermelon tones of New World expressions. <strong>Saignée method rosés</strong> (made by "bleeding off" juice from red grape fermentation) tend toward deeper copper-pink shades, while <strong>direct-press rosés</strong> showcase lighter, more delicate coloring. The wine's viscosity—visible as "legs" when swirled—indicates alcohol level and body, with lighter Provence styles showing minimal viscosity compared to richer Tavel or Bandol rosés.</p>

<h3 class="text-wine-700 mb-3">Aromatic Profile</h3>
<p>Premium rosé wines offer layered aromatics that evolve in the glass. <strong>Primary fruit aromas</strong> dominate young examples: fresh strawberry, raspberry, and white peach in Grenache-based rosés, while Pinot Noir rosés exhibit cherry and cranberry notes. <strong>Secondary fermentation aromas</strong> contribute brioche-like yeast notes in traditional method sparkling rosés, or the subtle banana and pear esters from cool temperature fermentation. <strong>Tertiary development</strong> in aged rosés reveals dried rose petal, orange zest, and subtle spice complexity—particularly notable in premium Champagne rosés or aged Tavel.</p>

<h3 class="text-wine-700 mb-3">Palate Structure and Mouthfeel</h3>
<p>Most rosés present a <strong>light to medium body</strong> with vibrant acidity that creates a refreshing, mouth-watering sensation. The best examples balance this acidity with subtle fruit sweetness (though technically dry) and minimal tannins—just enough to provide gentle grip without astringency. Alcohol typically ranges from 11.5-13.5% ABV, creating a clean, crisp impression rather than warmth or weight.</p>

<h3 class="text-wine-700 mb-3">Flavor Characteristics</h3>
<p>The flavor palette mirrors the aromatics but with added complexity: <strong>red berry fruits</strong> (strawberry, raspberry, red currant), <strong>stone fruits</strong> (peach, apricot), and <strong>citrus notes</strong> (grapefruit zest, lime). Premium rosés from limestone-rich soils like Provence or Sancerre show distinctive <strong>mineral undertones</strong>—a saline, chalky quality that adds sophistication. Herbal notes of lavender, thyme, or garrigue (Mediterranean scrubland) appear in southern French styles.</p>

<h3 class="text-wine-700 mb-3">Quality Markers</h3>
<p>Superior rosés demonstrate <strong>aromatic intensity</strong> without being cloying, <strong>precise acid balance</strong> that enlivens rather than sharpens, and a <strong>clean, persistent finish</strong> lasting 30+ seconds. The absence of residual sugar sensation (even in off-dry styles) and seamless integration of alcohol indicate careful winemaking and quality fruit sources.</p>

</div>

<h2>Origins & History</h2>

<p>Rosé wine's origins trace back to ancient civilizations, making it one of the world's oldest wine styles—predating both modern red and white winemaking techniques by millennia. Archaeological evidence suggests that the first wines produced in regions like <strong>Georgia, Armenia, and the eastern Mediterranean</strong> around 6000 BCE were naturally rosé in color, as ancient winemakers lacked the knowledge to extract deep color from grape skins.</p>

<p>The Greeks and Romans elevated rosé production throughout their empires, with <strong>Provence in southern France</strong> emerging as the style's spiritual homeland around 600 BCE when Greek settlers established vineyards near Marseille. The region's warm Mediterranean climate and limestone-rich soils proved ideal for producing the pale, dry rosés that would define the category. The name "rosé" itself derives from the Latin "rosatus," meaning "pinkish," though early French winemakers called these wines "clairet"—the etymological ancestor of the English word "claret."</p>

<h3>The Champagne Connection</h3>

<p>A pivotal moment came in the 17th century when <strong>Dom Pérignon and other Champagne producers</strong> began creating rosé Champagne through the saignée method—bleeding off pink juice from red grapes. This technique spread throughout France's wine regions, establishing rosé as a legitimate category rather than merely a winemaking accident.</p>

<h3>Modern Renaissance</h3>

<p>After declining in popularity during the mid-20th century due to association with sweet, mass-produced wines, rosé experienced a remarkable renaissance beginning in the 1990s. <strong>Provence producers like Domaines Ott and Château d'Esclans</strong> pioneered premium dry rosés that commanded serious prices and critical attention. The "Provence style"—bone-dry, pale salmon-colored wines with delicate fruit flavors—became the global gold standard.</p>

<p>Today, rosé represents one of wine's fastest-growing categories, with global consumption increasing by over 40% between 2002 and 2022. While France remains the largest producer at 7.5 million hectoliters annually, quality rosé production has expanded to <strong>Spain, Italy, California, Australia, and South Africa</strong>, each region developing distinctive styles that reflect their unique terroir and winemaking traditions.</p>

<h2>Grape Characteristics & Winemaking</h2>

<h3>The Foundation: Grape Selection and Viticulture</h3>

<p>Rosé production begins with strategic grape selection, as virtually any red grape variety can create exceptional pink wines. <strong>Pinot Noir</strong> thrives in cooler climates like Burgundy and Oregon, producing elegant rosés with bright acidity and delicate strawberry notes. The thin-skinned variety requires careful handling during harvest, typically picked in early morning to preserve freshness and prevent excessive color extraction.</p>

<p><strong>Grenache</strong>, the backbone of Provence rosés, demonstrates remarkable adaptability to Mediterranean climates. Its vigorous growth requires yield management—top producers limit yields to 35-40 hectoliters per hectare to concentrate flavors. The variety's thick skins provide controlled tannin extraction during brief skin contact periods of 2-12 hours.</p>

<p>Harvest timing proves crucial for rosé production. Grapes are picked earlier than for red wines, typically at 11-12% potential alcohol, preserving the bright acidity essential for refreshing rosé character while maintaining aromatic intensity.</p>

<h3>Winemaking Techniques: Precision in the Cellar</h3>

<p>Modern rosé production employs three primary methods: <strong>direct pressing</strong> (immediate separation of juice from skins), <strong>saignée</strong> (bleeding off juice from red wine fermentation), and <strong>skin contact</strong> (controlled maceration for 2-24 hours). Premium producers favor direct pressing or brief skin contact for precise color and flavor control.</p>

<p>Fermentation typically occurs in temperature-controlled stainless steel tanks at 55-65°F, preserving delicate aromatics and preventing excessive color development. Unlike many red wines, <strong>malolactic fermentation is generally avoided</strong> in rosé production to maintain crisp acidity and fresh fruit character, though some Loire Valley producers selectively employ partial MLF for added complexity.</p>

<h3>Regional Expression and Terroir</h3>

<p><strong>Provence rosés</strong> showcase mineral precision from limestone soils, expressing herbs de Provence alongside white peach and citrus. <strong>Bandol rosés</strong> from Mourvedre demonstrate greater structure and aging potential. <strong>Loire Valley Cabernet Franc</strong> rosés offer distinctive gooseberry and bell pepper notes, while <strong>Sancerre rosés</strong> from Pinot Noir display chalk-driven minerality.</p>

<h3>Quality Indicators and Aging Potential</h3>

<p>Premium rosés exhibit <strong>balanced acidity (6.5-7.5 g/L tartaric acid)</strong>, precise color intensity without browning, and complex aromatics beyond simple fruit. Quality indicators include clean fermentation character, appropriate alcohol levels (11.5-13.5%), and seamless integration of all components.</p>

<p>While most rosés are designed for immediate consumption, exceptional examples from <strong>Bandol, Tavel, and premium Champagne rosés</strong> can develop beautifully for 3-8 years. These wines evolve from bright fruit flavors toward more complex notes of dried herbs, honey, and mineral complexity while maintaining their essential freshness through balanced acidity.</p>

<h2>What Does Rosé Wine Taste Like?</h2>

<div class="bg-wine-50 p-6 rounded-lg">

<h3 class="text-wine-700 mb-4">Appearance and Visual Clues</h3>

<p>Rosé wines display a stunning spectrum of hues, from the palest salmon-pink of Provence styles to the deeper coral and onion-skin tones of Bandol or Tavel. The color intensity often correlates with production method—<strong>saignée</strong> (bleeding method) rosés typically show deeper pigmentation than direct-press versions. Young rosés exhibit brilliant clarity with vibrant, jewel-like transparency, while older examples may develop subtle amber or copper undertones around the rim, indicating bottle age and potential oxidation.</p>

<h3 class="text-wine-700 mb-4">Aromatic Profile</h3>

<p>Quality rosé wines offer layered aromatics that evolve in the glass. <strong>Primary fruit aromas</strong> dominate young examples: fresh strawberries, wild raspberries, white peach, and watermelon in delicate styles, progressing to red currant, cherry, and pink grapefruit in more structured wines. <strong>Secondary fermentation notes</strong> contribute subtle yeasty complexity, particularly in traditional method sparkling rosés, while some producers employ brief lees contact for added texture and brioche-like nuances.</p>

<p>Premium aged rosés develop <strong>tertiary characteristics</strong>—dried rose petals, orange zest, honey, and subtle spice notes that add sophisticated complexity without overwhelming the wine's inherent freshness.</p>

<h3 class="text-wine-700 mb-4">Palate Structure and Mouthfeel</h3>

<p>Most rosés present light to medium body with crisp, mouthwatering acidity that provides the backbone for food pairing versatility. Tannins remain minimal but perceptible in structured examples like Bandol or serious Spanish rosados, offering gentle grip without astringency. Alcohol levels typically range from 11.5-13.5%, contributing to the wine's refreshing character while maintaining adequate weight.</p>

<p>The texture varies from ethereally light Provence styles to more substantial examples with brief skin maceration, creating subtle phenolic texture that enhances complexity without compromising drinkability.</p>

<h3 class="text-wine-700 mb-4">Flavor Development and Finish</h3>

<p>On the palate, expect bright red berry fruits complemented by citrus zest, subtle herbs (thyme, rosemary), and mineral undertones reflecting terroir—chalky limestone in Champagne rosé, garrigue herbs in Provence, or saline minerality in coastal regions. Quality examples show flavor persistence and integration, with a clean, refreshing finish that invites the next sip.</p>

<p><strong>Premium quality markers</strong> include balanced fruit-acid harmony, complex aromatic layers, elegant mouthfeel, and a finish that extends beyond simple fruit flavors to include subtle spice, mineral, or floral notes that speak to terroir and careful winemaking.</p>

  <h2>Expert Tips</h2>
<ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-4 text-gray-700">
  <li><strong>Master the Color-Quality Connection</strong> - The hue of rosé wine directly indicates its production method and flavor intensity. Pale salmon-pink rosés (like Provence styles) come from brief skin contact and offer delicate white peach and citrus notes, while deeper copper-pink wines (like Tavel or Bandol) undergo longer maceration, delivering strawberry and herb complexity. Avoid rosés with brown or orange tinges—these indicate oxidation or poor winemaking.</li>

  <li><strong>Serve at Precisely 45-50°F for Optimal Expression</strong> - Unlike red wines, rosé's delicate aromatics and refreshing acidity are best showcased when properly chilled. Store bottles at 45°F and let them warm slightly to 50°F in the glass. This temperature range preserves the wine's crisp minerality while allowing fruit flavors to emerge. Over-chilling below 40°F mutes the bouquet, while serving above 55°F makes rosé taste flabby and alcoholic.</li>

  <li><strong>Skip the Decanter—Rosé Needs Immediate Enjoyment</strong> - Unlike structured reds, rosé wines gain nothing from decanting and can actually lose their signature freshness through excessive aeration. Pour directly into glasses to preserve the wine's bright acidity and delicate aromatics. The exception: vintage Champagne rosé, which benefits from gentle swirling in the glass to release complex yeasty notes.</li>

  <li><strong>Choose White Wine Glasses for Maximum Aroma</strong> - Despite its pink color, rosé performs best in white wine glasses with a narrower bowl than red wine stems. The smaller opening concentrates delicate floral and fruit aromas—think rose petals, white strawberry, and citrus zest—that define quality rosé. Burgundy-style bowls are too wide and dissipate these subtle aromatics before they reach your nose.</li>

  <li><strong>Understand the 18-Month Rule</strong> - Most rosé wines are crafted for immediate consumption and peak within 18 months of vintage. However, serious rosés from Bandol, Tavel, or premium Champagne houses can age 3-5 years, developing honeyed complexity while maintaining freshness. Check the vintage date: drink everyday rosés within two years, but cellar premium bottlings from top producers for enhanced depth.</li>

  <li><strong>Time Your Consumption with Seasonal Precision</strong> - Open rosé between April and September when its refreshing qualities complement warmer weather and lighter foods. Winter rosé consumption works best with heartier, spiced versions from regions like Côtes du Rhône or Spanish Rosado. The wine's natural acidity and fruit-forward profile make it ideal for outdoor dining and summer entertaining.</li>

  <li><strong>Identify Quality Through Residual Sugar Detection</strong> - Premium rosé should finish bone-dry with less than 4 grams/liter residual sugar, creating a clean, mineral finish. Inferior rosés often mask poor fruit quality with noticeable sweetness. Taste for a crisp, dry finish with bright acidity—if you detect sweetness beyond subtle fruit flavors, choose a different bottle. French AOC rosés and quality Spanish Rosado maintain this dry profile consistently.</li>

  <li><strong>Match Rosé Styles to Food Intensity</strong> - Light Provençal rosés pair with shellfish, salads, and fresh cheeses, while structured rosés from Bandol or Corsica complement grilled salmon, herb-crusted chicken, or charcuterie. The wine's tannin level—virtually absent in pale styles, subtle in darker versions—should match your food's weight. This pairing principle transforms rosé from a simple sipper into a serious food wine.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Aging & Cellaring</h2>

<p>Unlike their red counterparts, most rosé wines are crafted for immediate enjoyment, with <strong>90% reaching peak drinking quality within 1-3 years of vintage</strong>. However, understanding proper cellaring techniques can help you maximize your rosé's potential and recognize when it's past its prime.</p>

<h3>Aging Potential by Style</h3>

<p><strong>Provence-style rosés</strong> from premium producers like Domaine Tempier or Château d'Esclans typically maintain freshness for 2-4 years, while <strong>Bandol rosés</strong> with higher tannin structure can evolve beautifully for 5-7 years. Spanish rosados from Rioja, made with Tempranillo, often improve over 3-5 years as their structured backbone supports longer aging.</p>

<p><strong>Light, fruity rosés</strong> from regions like Loire Valley or basic Côtes de Provence should be consumed within 18 months to preserve their vibrant acidity and fresh strawberry-watermelon character.</p>

<h3>Evolution Over Time</h3>

<p>Well-structured rosés develop fascinating complexity with proper aging. The bright pink hue gradually shifts to <strong>salmon or onion-skin tones</strong>, while primary fruit flavors transform from fresh berries to dried fruits and subtle spice notes. Quality rosés gain textural richness as phenolic compounds integrate, creating a more harmonious mouthfeel.</p>

<h3>Optimal Storage Conditions</h3>

<p>Store rosé wines at <strong>55°F (13°C) with 60-70% humidity</strong> in a dark environment. Unlike reds, rosés benefit from slightly cooler storage to preserve their delicate aromatics. Position bottles horizontally to keep corks moist, preventing premature oxidation.</p>

<h3>Aging vs. Spoilage Indicators</h3>

<p>Properly aged rosé maintains bright acidity and develops <strong>honeyed complexity</strong> while retaining fruit character. Warning signs of spoilage include brown discoloration, flat mouthfeel, or volatile acidity creating sharp, vinegary aromas. Trust your palate—if the wine has lost its refreshing quality, it's likely past its drinking window.</p>

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<div class="space-y-6">
  <div>
    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-wine-700 mb-2">What's the difference between dry rosé and sweet rosé wines?</h3>
    <p class="text-gray-700">Dry rosés contain less than 4 grams of residual sugar per liter, resulting in crisp, clean flavors that showcase pure fruit and mineral characteristics. Sweet rosés, like White Zinfandel or some Provence styles, contain 12+ grams of residual sugar, creating softer, fruit-forward wines with candy-like sweetness. The production method—particularly when fermentation is stopped—determines the final sweetness level.</p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-wine-700 mb-2">How do I choose a good rosé wine for beginners?</h3>
    <p class="text-gray-700">Start with Provence rosés from producers like Whispering Angel or Miraval for their consistent quality and food-friendly dryness. Look for pale salmon or onion-skin colors rather than deep pink, as lighter hues typically indicate more elegant, sophisticated styles. Avoid rosés with screwcaps from mass-market brands, and instead seek bottles from established wine regions like Côtes de Provence, Loire Valley, or Navarra.</p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-wine-700 mb-2">What temperature should I serve rosé wine and why does it matter?</h3>
    <p class="text-gray-700">Serve rosé between 45-50°F (7-10°C), significantly colder than red wine but slightly warmer than most whites. This temperature preserves the wine's delicate aromatics while maintaining its refreshing acidity and preventing the alcohol from becoming prominent. Too cold (under 40°F) and you'll mute the fruit flavors; too warm (over 55°F) and the wine becomes flabby and loses its crisp character.</p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-wine-700 mb-2">Should I age rosé wine or drink it immediately?</h3>
    <p class="text-gray-700">Most rosés are designed for immediate consumption within 1-2 years of release to preserve their fresh, vibrant fruit character. The wine's color will fade from pink to orange-brown over time, and the bright acidity that makes rosé so appealing will diminish. Only exceptional rosés from top producers like Domaine Tempier Bandol or serious Tavel wines can improve with 3-5 years of aging.</p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-wine-700 mb-2">What are the biggest mistakes people make when buying rosé?</h3>
    <p class="text-gray-700">The most common error is choosing rosé based on deep, saturated color, assuming it indicates quality—when actually the opposite is true for most premium styles. Many people also buy rosé from the wrong vintage, selecting bottles that are 2+ years old when fresher vintages are available. Additionally, storing rosé in warm conditions or bright light destroys its delicate color and fresh fruit characteristics.</p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-wine-700 mb-2">Which rosé wine regions offer the best value for money?</h3>
    <p class="text-gray-700">Portugal's Vinho Verde rosé offers exceptional value at $8-12, delivering crisp, low-alcohol refreshment perfect for casual sipping. Spanish Navarra rosé provides Provence-style quality at half the price ($12-18), while Loire Valley rosés from producers like Henri Bourgeois offer mineral complexity at $15-25. Avoid overpriced Hamptons or celebrity-branded rosés that charge premium prices for average quality.</p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-wine-700 mb-2">What are good alternatives if I can't find quality rosé wine?</h3>
    <p class="text-gray-700">Light, chilled red wines like Beaujolais or Pinot Noir can provide similar refreshing qualities when served at 50-55°F. Dry white wines with good acidity, such as Sancerre or Albariño, offer comparable food-pairing versatility and crispness. For special occasions, consider Champagne rosé or Crémant de Loire rosé, which provide the elegance and celebration factor that still rosé often accompanies.</p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-wine-700 mb-2">How can I tell if a rosé wine has gone bad or is past its prime?</h3>
    <p class="text-gray-700">A rosé past its prime will show orange or brown tinges instead of fresh pink hues, indicating oxidation and age. On the nose, you'll detect sherry-like or nutty aromas rather than bright berry or floral notes, and the taste will be flat with muted fruit and reduced acidity. Unlike red wines that develop complexity with age, rosé simply loses its defining characteristics of freshness and vibrancy when it deteriorates.</p>
