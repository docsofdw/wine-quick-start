<h2>Origins & History</h2>

<p>Rosé wine's origins trace back to the ancient world, where the production method emerged naturally from the winemaking process itself. The earliest wines were likely closer to today's rosés than the deep red wines we know now, as ancient winemakers lacked the knowledge to extract maximum color from grape skins. Archaeological evidence from <strong>Georgia and Armenia</strong> suggests rosé-style wines were being produced over 6,000 years ago, making it potentially the world's oldest wine style.</p>

<p>The <strong>Provence region of France</strong> established the modern foundation for rosé excellence around 600 BCE when Greek colonists planted vineyards near Marseille. The Romans later refined these techniques, with Pliny the Elder documenting rosé wines from the region. The term "rosé" itself derives from the French word for "pink," though historically these wines were called <strong>"clairet"</strong> in Bordeaux and "oeil de perdrix" (partridge eye) in Burgundy, referencing their delicate color.</p>

<p>A pivotal moment came in the 18th century when <strong>Château d'Esclans</strong> and other Provence estates began deliberately crafting rosé as a premium wine rather than a byproduct. However, rosé's reputation suffered in the mid-20th century due to mass-produced, overly sweet versions like White Zinfandel, which dominated American markets from the 1970s onward.</p>

<p>The modern rosé renaissance began in the early 2000s, driven by <strong>Provence's marketing of "rosé lifestyle"</strong> and celebrity endorsements. Premium producers like Domaines Ott, Château Minuty, and Whispering Angel elevated the category's image. The method spread globally, with exceptional rosés now emerging from <strong>Spain's Navarra</strong>, California's Central Coast, Australia's Adelaide Hills, and New Zealand's Central Otago.</p>

<p>Today, rosé represents the fastest-growing wine category globally, with consumption increasing by <strong>40% between 2010-2020</strong>. France remains the largest producer at 35% of global volume, followed by Spain (15%) and the United States (10%). The style's versatility—from bone-dry Provence classics to fruit-forward New World expressions—continues driving its popularity across diverse markets and food cultures.</p>

<h2>Grape Characteristics & Winemaking</h2>

<h3>Viticulture: The Foundation of Great Rosé</h3>
<p>Rosé production begins in the vineyard, where grape selection and harvest timing are critical. Unlike red wine production that aims for full phenolic ripeness, rosé winemaking requires a delicate balance. Most quality rosé producers harvest slightly earlier than for red wines—typically when grapes reach 12-13% potential alcohol—to preserve the bright acidity that defines exceptional rosé. Pinot Noir thrives in cooler climates like Provence and Sancerre, developing elegant aromatics without excessive sugar accumulation. Grenache, the backbone of Provence rosé, tolerates Mediterranean heat while maintaining freshness when grown at elevation or near cooling sea breezes.</p>

<p>Yield management plays a crucial role in concentration. Premium Provence producers limit yields to 35-45 hectoliters per hectare, significantly lower than allowed maximums. This restriction concentrates flavors and creates the mineral backbone that distinguishes fine rosé from bulk production.</p>

<h3>Winemaking Techniques: Color and Flavor Extraction</h3>
<p>The hallmark of rosé winemaking is controlled color extraction through three primary methods. <strong>Direct pressing</strong> involves pressing red grapes immediately, creating the palest salmon-hued wines with delicate flavors—the signature style of premium Provence rosé. <strong>Saignée</strong> (bleeding) draws off pink juice after brief skin contact, typically 2-12 hours, producing wines with more color and body. <strong>Skin contact maceration</strong> allows extended contact up to 24 hours for darker, more structured rosés.</p>

<p>Temperature-controlled fermentation in stainless steel tanks at 60-65°F preserves the fresh fruit aromatics essential to quality rosé. While most rosé avoids oak aging to maintain purity, some producers use neutral barrels for texture without imparting woody flavors. Malolactic fermentation is typically blocked through sulfur dioxide additions and cool storage, preserving the crisp malic acidity that provides rosé's characteristic freshness.</p>

<h3>Regional Expression and Quality Indicators</h3>
<p>Terroir dramatically influences rosé character. Provence's limestone soils and Mediterranean climate produce mineral-driven wines with herbes de Provence aromatics. Loire Valley rosé from Sancerre's kimmeridgian soils shows flinty minerality and red berry precision, while Bandol's mourvèdre-based rosés develop garrigue complexity from red clay terraces.</p>

<p><strong>Quality indicators</strong> include vibrant acidity (pH below 3.5), clean fruit expression without oxidative notes, and balanced alcohol levels between 12-13.5%. Premium rosés display complexity beyond simple fruit flavors, showing mineral nuances and textural depth.</p>

<h3>Aging Potential and Evolution</h3>
<p>While most rosé is designed for immediate consumption, exceptional examples age gracefully for 3-5 years. Top Provence rosés develop honeyed complexity while maintaining freshness, and serious Tavel rosés can evolve for up to seven years. Proper storage at 55°F preserves the delicate aromatics that make rosé so compelling in its youth.</p>

<h2>What Does Rosé Wine Taste Like?</h2>

<h3 class="text-wine-700 font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Appearance and Visual Cues</h3>
<p>Rosé wines display a captivating spectrum of pink hues, from the palest salmon-tinged "onion skin" color of Provence rosés to the deeper copper-rose shades of wines with extended skin contact. The color intensity directly correlates with winemaking technique—lighter styles result from brief skin contact (2-24 hours), while darker rosés may involve the saignée method, where juice is "bled off" from red wine fermentation. Quality rosés should appear brilliant and clear, with medium-minus viscosity creating gentle legs that indicate moderate alcohol and glycerol content.</p>

<h3 class="text-wine-700 font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Aromatic Profile</h3>
<p><strong>Primary aromas</strong> burst with fresh fruit character: wild strawberries, white peach, watermelon rind, and pink grapefruit dominate lighter styles, while deeper rosés reveal red cherry, raspberry, and blood orange. <strong>Secondary aromas</strong> from fermentation contribute subtle yeasty notes and occasionally a whisper of lactic creaminess from malolactic conversion. Premium aged examples develop <strong>tertiary complexity</strong>—dried rose petals, orange blossom, and delicate spice notes that add sophisticated depth without overwhelming the wine's inherent freshness.</p>

<h3 class="text-wine-700 font-semibolic mt-6 mb-3">Palate Structure and Texture</h3>
<p>Most rosés present medium-minus to medium body with vibrant acidity that creates mouthwatering freshness—typically 6-7 g/L total acidity. Tannins remain barely perceptible, contributing subtle grip rather than astringency. Alcohol levels usually range from 11.5-13.5%, providing warmth without heaviness. The texture should feel clean and refreshing, with a silky mouthfeel in premium examples.</p>

<h3 class="text-wine-700 font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Flavor Development and Finish</h3>
<p>On the palate, rosé wines typically echo their aromatic profile with additional complexity. Expect flavors of <strong>red berries</strong> (strawberry, raspberry), <strong>citrus</strong> (pink grapefruit, mandarin), and <strong>stone fruits</strong> (white peach, nectarine). Mineral undertones appear in wines from limestone soils—think wet chalk or river stones. Herbal notes like dried Provence herbs or white pepper add savory complexity in food-friendly styles.</p>

<p class="bg-wine-50 p-4 rounded-lg">The finish should be <strong>clean and persistent</strong> but not overly long—typically 30-45 seconds in quality examples. Look for a refreshing aftertaste with lingering fruit and mineral notes, avoiding any bitter or cloying sensations that indicate poor winemaking or excessive residual sugar.</p>

<h3 class="text-wine-700 font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Quality Markers</h3>
<p>Premium rosé wines exhibit <strong>aromatic intensity</strong>, <strong>balanced acidity</strong>, and <strong>complex layering</strong> of fruit, floral, and mineral elements. The best examples maintain freshness while offering depth—avoiding simple or one-dimensional profiles that characterize mass-market styles.</p>

<h2>Origins & History</h2>

<p>Rosé wine's origins trace back to ancient civilizations, making it one of the world's oldest wine styles—predating both modern red and white winemaking techniques by millennia. Archaeological evidence suggests that the first wines produced in regions like <strong>Georgia, Armenia, and the eastern Mediterranean</strong> around 6000 BCE were naturally rosé in color, as ancient winemakers lacked the knowledge to extract deep color from grape skins.</p>

<p>The Greeks and Romans elevated rosé production throughout their empires, with <strong>Provence in southern France</strong> emerging as the style's spiritual homeland around 600 BCE when Greek settlers established vineyards near Marseille. The region's warm Mediterranean climate and limestone-rich soils proved ideal for producing the pale, dry rosés that would define the category. The name "rosé" itself derives from the Latin "rosatus," meaning "pinkish," though early French winemakers called these wines "clairet"—the etymological ancestor of the English word "claret."</p>

<h3>The Champagne Connection</h3>

<p>A pivotal moment came in the 17th century when <strong>Dom Pérignon and other Champagne producers</strong> began creating rosé Champagne through the saignée method—bleeding off pink juice from red grapes. This technique spread throughout France's wine regions, establishing rosé as a legitimate category rather than merely a winemaking accident.</p>

<h3>Modern Renaissance</h3>

<p>After declining in popularity during the mid-20th century due to association with sweet, mass-produced wines, rosé experienced a remarkable renaissance beginning in the 1990s. <strong>Provence producers like Domaines Ott and Château d'Esclans</strong> pioneered premium dry rosés that commanded serious prices and critical attention. The "Provence style"—bone-dry, pale salmon-colored wines with delicate fruit flavors—became the global gold standard.</p>

<p>Today, rosé represents one of wine's fastest-growing categories, with global consumption increasing by over 40% between 2002 and 2022. While France remains the largest producer at 7.5 million hectoliters annually, quality rosé production has expanded to <strong>Spain, Italy, California, Australia, and South Africa</strong>, each region developing distinctive styles that reflect their unique terroir and winemaking traditions.</p>

<h2>Grape Characteristics & Winemaking</h2>

<h3>The Foundation: Grape Selection and Viticulture</h3>

<p>Rosé production begins with strategic grape selection, as virtually any red grape variety can create exceptional pink wines. <strong>Pinot Noir</strong> thrives in cooler climates like Burgundy and Oregon, producing elegant rosés with bright acidity and delicate strawberry notes. The thin-skinned variety requires careful handling during harvest, typically picked in early morning to preserve freshness and prevent excessive color extraction.</p>

<p><strong>Grenache</strong>, the backbone of Provence rosés, demonstrates remarkable adaptability to Mediterranean climates. Its vigorous growth requires yield management—top producers limit yields to 35-40 hectoliters per hectare to concentrate flavors. The variety's thick skins provide controlled tannin extraction during brief skin contact periods of 2-12 hours.</p>

<p>Harvest timing proves crucial for rosé production. Grapes are picked earlier than for red wines, typically at 11-12% potential alcohol, preserving the bright acidity essential for refreshing rosé character while maintaining aromatic intensity.</p>

<h3>Winemaking Techniques: Precision in the Cellar</h3>

<p>Modern rosé production employs three primary methods: <strong>direct pressing</strong> (immediate separation of juice from skins), <strong>saignée</strong> (bleeding off juice from red wine fermentation), and <strong>skin contact</strong> (controlled maceration for 2-24 hours). Premium producers favor direct pressing or brief skin contact for precise color and flavor control.</p>

<p>Fermentation typically occurs in temperature-controlled stainless steel tanks at 55-65°F, preserving delicate aromatics and preventing excessive color development. Unlike many red wines, <strong>malolactic fermentation is generally avoided</strong> in rosé production to maintain crisp acidity and fresh fruit character, though some Loire Valley producers selectively employ partial MLF for added complexity.</p>

<h3>Regional Expression and Terroir</h3>

<p><strong>Provence rosés</strong> showcase mineral precision from limestone soils, expressing herbs de Provence alongside white peach and citrus. <strong>Bandol rosés</strong> from Mourvedre demonstrate greater structure and aging potential. <strong>Loire Valley Cabernet Franc</strong> rosés offer distinctive gooseberry and bell pepper notes, while <strong>Sancerre rosés</strong> from Pinot Noir display chalk-driven minerality.</p>

<h3>Quality Indicators and Aging Potential</h3>

<p>Premium rosés exhibit <strong>balanced acidity (6.5-7.5 g/L tartaric acid)</strong>, precise color intensity without browning, and complex aromatics beyond simple fruit. Quality indicators include clean fermentation character, appropriate alcohol levels (11.5-13.5%), and seamless integration of all components.</p>

<p>While most rosés are designed for immediate consumption, exceptional examples from <strong>Bandol, Tavel, and premium Champagne rosés</strong> can develop beautifully for 3-8 years. These wines evolve from bright fruit flavors toward more complex notes of dried herbs, honey, and mineral complexity while maintaining their essential freshness through balanced acidity.</p>

<h2>What Does Rosé Wine Taste Like?</h2>

<div class="bg-wine-50 p-6 rounded-lg">

<h3 class="text-wine-700 mb-4">Appearance and Visual Clues</h3>

<p>Rosé wines display a stunning spectrum of hues, from the palest salmon-pink of Provence styles to the deeper coral and onion-skin tones of Bandol or Tavel. The color intensity often correlates with production method—<strong>saignée</strong> (bleeding method) rosés typically show deeper pigmentation than direct-press versions. Young rosés exhibit brilliant clarity with vibrant, jewel-like transparency, while older examples may develop subtle amber or copper undertones around the rim, indicating bottle age and potential oxidation.</p>

<h3 class="text-wine-700 mb-4">Aromatic Profile</h3>

<p>Quality rosé wines offer layered aromatics that evolve in the glass. <strong>Primary fruit aromas</strong> dominate young examples: fresh strawberries, wild raspberries, white peach, and watermelon in delicate styles, progressing to red currant, cherry, and pink grapefruit in more structured wines. <strong>Secondary fermentation notes</strong> contribute subtle yeasty complexity, particularly in traditional method sparkling rosés, while some producers employ brief lees contact for added texture and brioche-like nuances.</p>

<p>Premium aged rosés develop <strong>tertiary characteristics</strong>—dried rose petals, orange zest, honey, and subtle spice notes that add sophisticated complexity without overwhelming the wine's inherent freshness.</p>

<h3 class="text-wine-700 mb-4">Palate Structure and Mouthfeel</h3>

<p>Most rosés present light to medium body with crisp, mouthwatering acidity that provides the backbone for food pairing versatility. Tannins remain minimal but perceptible in structured examples like Bandol or serious Spanish rosados, offering gentle grip without astringency. Alcohol levels typically range from 11.5-13.5%, contributing to the wine's refreshing character while maintaining adequate weight.</p>

<p>The texture varies from ethereally light Provence styles to more substantial examples with brief skin maceration, creating subtle phenolic texture that enhances complexity without compromising drinkability.</p>

<h3 class="text-wine-700 mb-4">Flavor Development and Finish</h3>

<p>On the palate, expect bright red berry fruits complemented by citrus zest, subtle herbs (thyme, rosemary), and mineral undertones reflecting terroir—chalky limestone in Champagne rosé, garrigue herbs in Provence, or saline minerality in coastal regions. Quality examples show flavor persistence and integration, with a clean, refreshing finish that invites the next sip.</p>

<p><strong>Premium quality markers</strong> include balanced fruit-acid harmony, complex aromatic layers, elegant mouthfeel, and a finish that extends beyond simple fruit flavors to include subtle spice, mineral, or floral notes that speak to terroir and careful winemaking.</p>

  <h2>Expert Tips</h2>
<ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-4 text-gray-700">
  <li><strong>Color Reveals Production Method</strong> - When selecting rosé, examine the hue to decode quality and style. Pale salmon indicates saignée method from premium red grapes like Pinot Noir, while deeper coral suggests direct press Grenache or Syrah. Avoid bright pink wines with purple tinges—these often indicate inferior bleeding method or artificial enhancement. The most elegant rosés show copper-orange highlights, indicating proper phenolic extraction.</li>

  <li><strong>Serve at Precise 45-50°F for Optimal Expression</strong> - Unlike white wines that can handle colder temps, rosé's delicate fruit aromatics shut down below 45°F and become flabby above 50°F. Chill for exactly 90 minutes in refrigerator or 20 minutes in ice bath. At proper temperature, you'll taste the wine's full spectrum from red fruit brightness to mineral backbone—crucial elements often missed in over-chilled bottles.</li>

  <li><strong>Skip the Decanter, Embrace Immediate Service</strong> - Rosé's charm lies in its fresh, reductive character—decanting actually diminishes these qualities by introducing oxygen that mutes delicate floral notes. Pour directly from bottle to glass, and if serving multiple bottles, open them sequentially rather than all at once. The exception: vintage Champagne rosé benefits from 15-minute settling after opening.</li>

  <li><strong>Use Bordeaux-Style Glasses for Complex Rosés</strong> - While flutes work for rosé Champagne, still rosés perform best in medium-bowl glasses with slight inward taper. This shape concentrates the wine's often-subtle aromatics while providing enough surface area for proper aeration. Avoid wide Burgundy bowls that dissipate rosé's delicate nose, and never use thick-rimmed glasses that interfere with the wine's crisp finish.</li>

  <li><strong>Follow the 18-Month Freshness Rule</strong> - Most rosés peak within 6-12 months of vintage date and decline rapidly after 18 months. Check the back label for bottling date—wines bottled more than 6 months after harvest often show diminished fruit. Notable exceptions include Bandol rosé (ages 2-3 years), vintage rosé Champagne (5-10 years), and Tavel (up to 3 years due to higher tannin structure).</li>

  <li><strong>Identify Serious Rosés by Their Texture</strong> - Premium rosés exhibit a subtle textural weight from brief skin contact and proper lees aging. Look for wines with gentle grip on the mid-palate—not aggressive tannins, but noticeable structure. Wines that taste purely acidic and watery lack this complexity. Provence rosés from old-vine Mourvèdre show this texture beautifully, as do Loire Cabernet Franc rosés.</li>

  <li><strong>Match Rosé Style to Season and Food</strong> - Light, dry rosés (Provence style) excel in spring with seafood and salads, while fuller-bodied rosés (Bandol, Rioja) handle summer grilling and heartier fare. Semi-dry rosés complement spicy Asian cuisine year-round. Reserve vintage rosé Champagne for autumn celebrations when its developed complexity shines alongside richer dishes.</li>

  <li><strong>Storage Matters More Than You Think</strong> - Rosé's pale color offers little UV protection—store bottles in complete darkness or wrapped in tissue. Temperature fluctuations above 65°F accelerate aging and create cooked flavors. If buying for future consumption, choose bottles with dark glass and avoid any stored under bright retail lighting. Once opened, rosé maintains quality for only 2-3 days refrigerated, compared to 3-5 days for robust reds.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Aging & Cellaring</h2>

<p>Most rosé wines are crafted for immediate enjoyment, but understanding their aging potential helps maximize your investment and drinking pleasure.</p>

<h3>Aging Potential by Style</h3>

<p><strong>Provence and high-end rosés</strong> from producers like Domaine Tempier or Château d'Esclans can develop beautifully for 3-5 years, gaining complexity while retaining freshness. <strong>Champagne rosé</strong> and serious sparkling wines age gracefully for 5-8 years, developing toasty, brioche notes alongside evolved fruit.</p>

<p><strong>Everyday rosés</strong> from regions like Languedoc or Spanish Rosado peak within 12-18 months, when their vibrant strawberry and citrus notes shine brightest. <strong>Rosé Burgundy</strong> and Sancerre rosé can reward patience for 2-4 years, developing mineral complexity and deeper fruit concentration.</p>

<h3>Evolution Over Time</h3>

<p>Well-made rosés evolve from bright berry and floral notes toward more complex profiles featuring dried herbs, white pepper, and subtle honey undertones. The wine's pale salmon hue may deepen slightly to copper-pink, while maintaining structural integrity through balanced acidity.</p>

<h3>Proper Storage Requirements</h3>

<p>Store rosé at consistent <strong>55-58°F</strong> with 60-70% humidity in a dark environment. Unlike reds, rosés should be consumed relatively young, making proper storage even more critical to preserve their delicate fruit character and prevent premature oxidation.</p>

<h3>Quality Indicators</h3>

<p><strong>Proper aging signs</strong> include integrated aromatics, silky texture development, and enhanced mineral notes. <strong>Warning signs of spoilage</strong> include browning color (beyond light copper tones), flat fruit character, excessive oxidation aromas resembling sherry, or loss of the wine's characteristic freshness and acidity that defines quality rosé.</p>

<div class="space-y-6">
  <div>
    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-wine-700 mb-2">What's the difference between dry and sweet rosé wines?</h3>
    <p class="text-gray-700">Dry rosé contains less than 4 grams of residual sugar per liter and showcases crisp acidity with mineral notes, while sweet rosé (like White Zinfandel) contains 12+ grams of residual sugar, creating a softer, fruit-forward profile. Most premium rosé from Provence, Bandol, and Loire Valley are bone dry, emphasizing terroir and grape character rather than sweetness. The best way to identify style is to check the alcohol level—dry rosé typically ranges from 11.5-13.5% ABV, while sweet versions often fall below 11%.</p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-wine-700 mb-2">How can I tell if a rosé wine is high quality just by looking at the bottle?</h3>
    <p class="text-gray-700">Look for pale salmon or onion-skin pink colors rather than bright magenta, which often indicates lower quality or added coloring. Premium rosé producers like Domaines Ott, Château d'Esclans, or Sancerre rosé typically use clear or antique glass bottles to showcase the wine's delicate hue. Check for specific vineyard designations, harvest dates, and avoid bottles with cartoon-like labels or overly saturated pink packaging, which often signal mass-produced, sweet styles.</p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-wine-700 mb-2">Should rosé wine be served as cold as white wine or warmer like red wine?</h3>
    <p class="text-gray-700">Serve rosé between 45-50°F (7-10°C), slightly warmer than most white wines but cooler than reds. This temperature preserves the wine's delicate aromatics while allowing its subtle fruit flavors and mineral complexity to shine through. Over-chilling rosé below 40°F mutes its flavor profile, while serving above 55°F can make it taste flabby and lose its refreshing character that makes rosé so appealing.</p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-wine-700 mb-2">Why do some rosé wines cost $15 while others cost $50 or more?</h3>
    <p class="text-gray-700">Premium rosé commands higher prices due to factors like prestigious terroir (Provence's Bandol AOC), low-yield vineyard practices, and extended lees aging that adds complexity. Expensive rosé often comes from old vines, hand-harvested grapes, and careful saignée or direct press methods that require more labor and expertise. Mass-produced rosé uses higher yields, machine harvesting, and rapid fermentation techniques that prioritize volume over complexity, resulting in simpler wines at lower price points.</p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-wine-700 mb-2">What's the biggest mistake people make when buying rosé wine?</h3>
    <p class="text-gray-700">The most common mistake is buying rosé that's more than 18 months old, as most rosé wines are designed for immediate consumption and lose their fresh, vibrant character with age. Always check the vintage date and choose the most recent year available, especially for Provence rosé, Pinot Grigio rosé, and Sancerre rosé. Another major error is assuming all rosé is sweet—many people miss out on exceptional dry rosé because they expect cloying sweetness based on outdated perceptions.</p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-wine-700 mb-2">Can rosé wine be aged like red or white wines?</h3>
    <p class="text-gray-700">Most rosé wines are not designed for aging and should be consumed within 1-2 years of vintage for optimal freshness and fruit character. However, exceptional rosé from producers like Domaine Tempier (Bandol), Château Simone, or premium Tavel can develop beautifully for 3-5 years, gaining complexity and savory notes. These age-worthy rosé typically have higher tannin content, lower pH, and come from prestigious appellations with structured winemaking approaches that differ from typical "drink now" styles.</p>

  <div>
    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-wine-700 mb-2">Is rosé wine a good choice for beginners who are just learning about wine?</h3>
    <p class="text-gray-700">Rosé is excellent for wine beginners because it bridges the gap between white and red wines, offering approachable fruit flavors without overwhelming tannins or excessive acidity. The visual appeal and food-friendly nature make rosé less intimidating than complex reds, while dry Provence styles introduce beginners to mineral complexity and terroir concepts. Start with well-known producers like Whispering Angel, Miraval, or AIX to experience quality benchmarks before exploring more adventurous regions like Corsica or Spain.</p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-wine-700 mb-2">What are the best alternatives if I can't find good French Provence rosé?</h3>
    <p class="text-gray-700">Excellent Provence-style alternatives include Spanish Garnacha rosé from Navarra, Italian Cerasuolo d'Abruzzo from Montepulciano grapes, and Austrian rosé from Zweigelt or Pinot Noir. California producers like Stolpman, Bedrock, and Arnot-Roberts create outstanding dry rosé using Provence techniques with local grapes. For similar pale color and mineral-driven profiles, look for rosé from Portugal's Vinho Verde region or Greek Roditis rosé, which offer exceptional value and comparable elegance to premium Provence bottlings.</p>
