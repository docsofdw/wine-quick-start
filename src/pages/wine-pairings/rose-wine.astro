  Global rose wine consumption has grown 23% over the past decade. This surge in popularity hasn't diluted quality—if you know where to look.

  <h2>Understanding Rose wine</h2>

  <h2>Origins & History</h2>

<p>Rosé wine's origins trace back to ancient civilizations, making it one of the world's oldest wine styles—predating both modern red and white winemaking techniques by millennia. Archaeological evidence suggests that the first wines produced in regions like <strong>Georgia, Armenia, and the eastern Mediterranean</strong> around 6000 BCE were naturally rosé in color, as ancient winemakers lacked the knowledge to extract deep color from grape skins.</p>

<h2>Origins & History</h2>

<p>The story of rosé wine stretches back over 2,600 years, making it arguably the world's oldest wine style. Archaeological evidence from ancient Greece and Rome reveals that the earliest wines were likely rosé in color, as ancient winemakers lacked the knowledge to fully extract deep color from red grape skins. The pale pink wines of antiquity were created through brief skin contact—a technique that remains fundamental to modern rosé production.</p>

<p>The term "rosé" derives from the French word for "pink," though this wine style emerged simultaneously across Mediterranean civilizations. <strong>Provence, France</strong>, particularly around Marseille, claims the distinction of producing the world's first intentional rosé wines around 600 BC when Greek colonists planted vineyards in the region. The Romans further refined these techniques, spreading rosé production throughout their empire and establishing many of the grape varieties still used today.</p>

<h3>The Renaissance of Pink Wine</h3>

<p>While rosé dominated wine production for millennia, its reputation suffered in the mid-20th century due to mass-produced, overly sweet examples like White Zinfandel. The modern rosé renaissance began in the 1970s when Provence producers like <strong>Domaines Ott</strong> elevated the category with bone-dry, elegant wines in distinctive amphora-shaped bottles. This "Provence style"—characterized by pale salmon hues and crisp minerality—became the global benchmark for premium rosé.</p>

<p>The 21st century has witnessed explosive growth in rosé consumption. Global plantings dedicated to rosé production have increased by over 35% since 2000, with France leading at 8.2 million hectoliters annually, followed by the United States and Spain. The <strong>#roséallday movement</strong> and celebrity endorsements have transformed rosé from a seasonal novelty into a year-round lifestyle wine.</p>

<p class="bg-wine-50 p-4 rounded">Today, virtually every wine-producing region crafts rosé, from traditional French appellations to innovative New World producers. Modern techniques allow winemakers to create rosé from any red grape variety, with <strong>Grenache, Syrah, Sangiovese, and Pinot Noir</strong> leading global production. This versatility has made rosé the fastest-growing wine category worldwide, with consumption increasing 30% over the past decade.</p>

<h2>Grape Characteristics & Winemaking</h2>

<h3>Viticulture: The Foundation of Quality Rosé</h3>
<p>Unlike dedicated rosé grapes, most premium rosé wines are crafted from red grape varieties grown specifically for pink wine production. <strong>Harvest timing proves critical</strong> – grapes are typically picked 1-2 weeks earlier than for red wines, maintaining higher acidity levels (6.5-7.5 g/L) essential for rosé's characteristic freshness. Yields often run higher than red wine production at 8-12 tons per acre, as winemakers seek concentrated flavors without the extended skin contact that builds tannin structure.</p>

<p>Cool climate regions like Provence and Sancerre excel at producing elegant rosés because moderate temperatures preserve the delicate aromatics and natural acidity. Warm climate producers in regions like Languedoc compensate through careful canopy management and night harvesting to retain freshness.</p>

<h3 class="text-wine-700">Winemaking Techniques: Crafting the Perfect Pink</h3>
<p>The magic happens through three primary methods: <strong>direct press</strong> (immediate pressing of red grapes), <strong>saignée</strong> (bleeding off juice from red wine production), and <strong>limited skin contact</strong> (2-24 hours of maceration). Direct press yields the most delicate styles, while saignée often produces more concentrated, food-friendly rosés with 13-14% alcohol.</p>

<p>Fermentation typically occurs in temperature-controlled stainless steel tanks at 55-65°F to preserve fresh fruit character. Most quality producers avoid malolactic fermentation to maintain crisp acidity, though some Provence estates like Domaine Tempier employ partial MLF for added texture. Oak aging remains rare, reserved for premium cuvées seeking additional complexity and aging potential.</p>

<h3>Regional Expression: Terroir in Pink</h3>
<p class="bg-wine-50 p-4 rounded">Provence rosés showcase mineral-driven elegance with pale onion-skin color and herbs de Provence aromatics. Languedoc expressions offer riper fruit profiles with strawberry and watermelon notes. Loire Valley rosés from Sancerre display sharp minerality and citrus precision, while Rhône rosés balance power with finesse through Grenache-based blends.</p>

<h3>Quality Indicators & Aging Potential</h3>
<p>Superior rosés display <strong>brilliant clarity</strong>, balanced acidity (6-8 g/L), and complex aromatics extending beyond simple red fruit. Quality producers maintain consistent color through proper cellar hygiene and SO2 management, avoiding the browning that plagues lesser examples.</p>

<p>While most rosés are designed for immediate consumption, premium examples from producers like Château d'Esclans and Domaine de Trevallon can evolve beautifully for 3-5 years. These wines develop secondary aromatics of dried herbs, honey, and subtle oxidative notes while maintaining their essential freshness. The key lies in proper storage at 55°F with consistent humidity – treat quality rosé with the same respect as fine white wine.</p>

<h2>What Does Rosé Wine Taste Like?</h2>

<h3 class="text-wine-700">Appearance and Visual Cues</h3>
<p>Rosé presents a captivating spectrum of hues, from the palest salmon pink of Provence styles to the deeper coral and copper tones of New World expressions. The color intensity directly correlates to skin contact time—longer maceration produces darker shades. Premium rosés typically display brilliant clarity with a subtle viscosity that creates gentle legs down the glass, indicating balanced alcohol levels between 11-13.5%. Avoid wines showing brown or orange tinges, which signal oxidation or excessive age.</p>

<h3 class="text-wine-700">Aromatic Complexity</h3>
<p>Quality rosé reveals distinct aromatic layers that unfold in the glass. <strong>Primary fruit aromas</strong> dominate, featuring fresh strawberry, raspberry, and watermelon in lighter styles, progressing to cherry, pomegranate, and white peach in more structured examples. Provence rosés often showcase delicate citrus zest and white flowers, while Spanish Garnacha rosados display riper stone fruit characteristics.</p>

<p><strong>Secondary fermentation notes</strong> add complexity—look for subtle bread crust from lees contact in premium Champagne rosés, or the gentle spice and herb qualities from stainless steel fermentation. <strong>Tertiary aging aromas</strong> develop in exceptional examples, contributing honeyed notes, dried flowers, and mineral complexity.</p>

<h3 class="text-wine-700">Palate Structure and Mouthfeel</h3>
<p>Rosé typically presents a light to medium body with vibrant acidity that creates a refreshing, mouth-watering sensation. The best examples balance this acidity with subtle fruit concentration, avoiding both flabbiness and excessive tartness. Tannins remain minimal—just enough to provide gentle structure without astringency. Alcohol should feel integrated, never hot or prominent, with a silky texture that enhances the wine's elegance.</p>

<h3 class="text-wine-700">Flavor Profile and Finish</h3>
<p>On the palate, expect layers of red berry fruits complemented by citrus notes and mineral undertones. Provence styles emphasize restraint with subtle herb de Provence and saline qualities, while New World rosés may show riper fruit expression with hints of spice. The finest examples reveal complex flavor development—initial fruit sweetness balanced by zesty acidity and a clean, persistent finish.</p>

<p><strong>Quality markers</strong> include a finish that extends beyond 30 seconds, displaying fruit purity without residual sugar cloyingness, integrated alcohol, and the distinctive "garrigue" herbal complexity found in Mediterranean expressions. Premium rosés maintain freshness while offering surprising depth and food-pairing versatility.</p>

<p>The Greeks and Romans elevated rosé production throughout their empires, with <strong>Provence in southern France</strong> emerging as the style's spiritual homeland around 600 BCE when Greek settlers established vineyards near Marseille. The region's warm Mediterranean climate and limestone-rich soils proved ideal for producing the pale, dry rosés that would define the category. The name "rosé" itself derives from the Latin "rosatus," meaning "pinkish," though early French winemakers called these wines "clairet"—the etymological ancestor of the English word "claret."</p>

<h3>The Champagne Connection</h3>

<p>A pivotal moment came in the 17th century when <strong>Dom Pérignon and other Champagne producers</strong> began creating rosé Champagne through the saignée method—bleeding off pink juice from red grapes. This technique spread throughout France's wine regions, establishing rosé as a legitimate category rather than merely a winemaking accident.</p>

<h3>Modern Renaissance</h3>

<p>After declining in popularity during the mid-20th century due to association with sweet, mass-produced wines, rosé experienced a remarkable renaissance beginning in the 1990s. <strong>Provence producers like Domaines Ott and Château d'Esclans</strong> pioneered premium dry rosés that commanded serious prices and critical attention. The "Provence style"—bone-dry, pale salmon-colored wines with delicate fruit flavors—became the global gold standard.</p>

<p>Today, rosé represents one of wine's fastest-growing categories, with global consumption increasing by over 40% between 2002 and 2022. While France remains the largest producer at 7.5 million hectoliters annually, quality rosé production has expanded to <strong>Spain, Italy, California, Australia, and South Africa</strong>, each region developing distinctive styles that reflect their unique terroir and winemaking traditions.</p>

<h2>Grape Characteristics & Winemaking</h2>

<h3>The Foundation: Grape Selection and Viticulture</h3>

<p>Rosé production begins with strategic grape selection, as virtually any red grape variety can create exceptional pink wines. <strong>Pinot Noir</strong> thrives in cooler climates like Burgundy and Oregon, producing elegant rosés with bright acidity and delicate strawberry notes. The thin-skinned variety requires careful handling during harvest, typically picked in early morning to preserve freshness and prevent excessive color extraction.</p>

<p><strong>Grenache</strong>, the backbone of Provence rosés, demonstrates remarkable adaptability to Mediterranean climates. Its vigorous growth requires yield management—top producers limit yields to 35-40 hectoliters per hectare to concentrate flavors. The variety's thick skins provide controlled tannin extraction during brief skin contact periods of 2-12 hours.</p>

<p>Harvest timing proves crucial for rosé production. Grapes are picked earlier than for red wines, typically at 11-12% potential alcohol, preserving the bright acidity essential for refreshing rosé character while maintaining aromatic intensity.</p>

<h3>Winemaking Techniques: Precision in the Cellar</h3>

<p>Modern rosé production employs three primary methods: <strong>direct pressing</strong> (immediate separation of juice from skins), <strong>saignée</strong> (bleeding off juice from red wine fermentation), and <strong>skin contact</strong> (controlled maceration for 2-24 hours). Premium producers favor direct pressing or brief skin contact for precise color and flavor control.</p>

<p>Fermentation typically occurs in temperature-controlled stainless steel tanks at 55-65°F, preserving delicate aromatics and preventing excessive color development. Unlike many red wines, <strong>malolactic fermentation is generally avoided</strong> in rosé production to maintain crisp acidity and fresh fruit character, though some Loire Valley producers selectively employ partial MLF for added complexity.</p>

<h3>Regional Expression and Terroir</h3>

<p><strong>Provence rosés</strong> showcase mineral precision from limestone soils, expressing herbs de Provence alongside white peach and citrus. <strong>Bandol rosés</strong> from Mourvedre demonstrate greater structure and aging potential. <strong>Loire Valley Cabernet Franc</strong> rosés offer distinctive gooseberry and bell pepper notes, while <strong>Sancerre rosés</strong> from Pinot Noir display chalk-driven minerality.</p>

<h3>Quality Indicators and Aging Potential</h3>

<p>Premium rosés exhibit <strong>balanced acidity (6.5-7.5 g/L tartaric acid)</strong>, precise color intensity without browning, and complex aromatics beyond simple fruit. Quality indicators include clean fermentation character, appropriate alcohol levels (11.5-13.5%), and seamless integration of all components.</p>

<p>While most rosés are designed for immediate consumption, exceptional examples from <strong>Bandol, Tavel, and premium Champagne rosés</strong> can develop beautifully for 3-8 years. These wines evolve from bright fruit flavors toward more complex notes of dried herbs, honey, and mineral complexity while maintaining their essential freshness through balanced acidity.</p>

<div class="bg-wine-50 p-6 rounded-lg">

<h3 class="text-wine-700 mb-4">Appearance and Visual Clues</h3>

<p>Rosé wines display a stunning spectrum of hues, from the palest salmon-pink of Provence styles to the deeper coral and onion-skin tones of Bandol or Tavel. The color intensity often correlates with production method—<strong>saignée</strong> (bleeding method) rosés typically show deeper pigmentation than direct-press versions. Young rosés exhibit brilliant clarity with vibrant, jewel-like transparency, while older examples may develop subtle amber or copper undertones around the rim, indicating bottle age and potential oxidation.</p>

<h3 class="text-wine-700 mb-4">Aromatic Profile</h3>

<p>Quality rosé wines offer layered aromatics that evolve in the glass. <strong>Primary fruit aromas</strong> dominate young examples: fresh strawberries, wild raspberries, white peach, and watermelon in delicate styles, progressing to red currant, cherry, and pink grapefruit in more structured wines. <strong>Secondary fermentation notes</strong> contribute subtle yeasty complexity, particularly in traditional method sparkling rosés, while some producers employ brief lees contact for added texture and brioche-like nuances.</p>

<p>Premium aged rosés develop <strong>tertiary characteristics</strong>—dried rose petals, orange zest, honey, and subtle spice notes that add sophisticated complexity without overwhelming the wine's inherent freshness.</p>

<h3 class="text-wine-700 mb-4">Palate Structure and Mouthfeel</h3>

<p>Most rosés present light to medium body with crisp, mouthwatering acidity that provides the backbone for food pairing versatility. Tannins remain minimal but perceptible in structured examples like Bandol or serious Spanish rosados, offering gentle grip without astringency. Alcohol levels typically range from 11.5-13.5%, contributing to the wine's refreshing character while maintaining adequate weight.</p>

<p>The texture varies from ethereally light Provence styles to more substantial examples with brief skin maceration, creating subtle phenolic texture that enhances complexity without compromising drinkability.</p>

<h3 class="text-wine-700 mb-4">Flavor Development and Finish</h3>

<p>On the palate, expect bright red berry fruits complemented by citrus zest, subtle herbs (thyme, rosemary), and mineral undertones reflecting terroir—chalky limestone in Champagne rosé, garrigue herbs in Provence, or saline minerality in coastal regions. Quality examples show flavor persistence and integration, with a clean, refreshing finish that invites the next sip.</p>

<p><strong>Premium quality markers</strong> include balanced fruit-acid harmony, complex aromatic layers, elegant mouthfeel, and a finish that extends beyond simple fruit flavors to include subtle spice, mineral, or floral notes that speak to terroir and careful winemaking.</p>

  <h2>Expert Tips</h2>
<ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-4 text-gray-700">
  <li><strong>Master the Color Spectrum for Quality Assessment</strong> - The hue of rosé tells you everything about production method and grape variety. Pale salmon-pink indicates direct press or saignée method with minimal skin contact, perfect for delicate Provence-style wines. Deeper coral or onion-skin colors suggest longer maceration or specific grapes like Grenache or Sangiovese. Avoid any rosé with orange or brown tinges, which indicate oxidation or age-related deterioration.</li>

  <li><strong>Serve at Precisely 45-50°F for Optimal Expression</strong> - Unlike red wines, rosé's delicate aromatics and crisp acidity shine when properly chilled. Too cold (below 40°F) and you'll mute the subtle strawberry and white peach notes; too warm (above 55°F) and the wine becomes flabby and loses its refreshing character. Place bottles in the refrigerator 2-3 hours before serving, or use an ice bucket for 20 minutes.</li>

  <li><strong>Skip the Decanter - Rosé Needs No Aeration</strong> - Rosé wines are crafted for immediate enjoyment and their delicate fruit flavors can actually be stripped away by excessive oxygen exposure. Pour directly from bottle to glass to preserve the wine's fresh, vibrant character. The only exception is vintage Champagne rosé, which may benefit from gentle swirling in the glass to release complex brioche and red fruit aromatics.</li>

  <li><strong>Choose White Wine Glasses Over Red for Better Aromatics</strong> - Use a smaller bowl white wine glass rather than a large red wine glass. Rosé's subtle aromatics - think wild strawberries, white flowers, and citrus zest - concentrate better in a narrower opening. Avoid flutes unless drinking sparkling rosé, as the restricted surface area limits the wine's ability to express its full aromatic complexity.</li>

  <li><strong>Follow the "Drink Young" Rule with Strategic Exceptions</strong> - Most still rosés should be consumed within 18 months of vintage date to capture their peak freshness. However, premium rosés from Bandol, Tavel, or Sancerre can evolve beautifully for 3-5 years, developing honeyed notes and mineral complexity. Vintage rosé Champagne can age gracefully for 8-10 years, gaining toasty, brioche-like characteristics.</li>

  <li><strong>Read the Back Label for Residual Sugar Clues</strong> - Many rosés contain 2-8 grams per liter of residual sugar to enhance their approachable character, but this isn't always obvious. Look for terms like "sec" (dry), "off-dry," or check the alcohol level - wines below 12% ABV often retain more residual sugar. Bone-dry rosés from Provence typically show 13-14% alcohol with less than 2g/L residual sugar.</li>

  <li><strong>Understand Regional Styles for Perfect Food Pairing</strong> - Provence rosé (pale, mineral-driven) pairs with seafood and salads; Rhône rosé (fuller-bodied, berry-forward) complements grilled meats; Loire rosé (crisp, herbaceous) matches goat cheese and vegetables; Spanish rosado (often darker, fruit-driven) works with tapas and spicy cuisine. Matching regional food traditions with local rosé styles creates harmonious pairings.</li>

  <li><strong>Store Unopened Bottles Away from Light and Heat</strong> - Rosé's delicate color compounds are particularly susceptible to UV damage and temperature fluctuations. Store bottles on their side in a cool, dark place (55-60°F) for up to two years maximum. Once opened, rosé maintains quality for only 2-3 days in the refrigerator with a vacuum seal, as its fresh fruit character fades quickly compared to more tannic red wines.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Aging & Cellaring</h2>

<p>Unlike red wines, most rosés are crafted for immediate enjoyment, but understanding their aging potential is crucial for maximizing your collection's value and pleasure.</p>

<h3>Aging Potential by Style</h3>
<p><strong>Light, fruit-forward rosés</strong> (Provence-style, Pinot Grigio rosato) peak within 1-2 years, as their delicate aromatics and crisp acidity begin to fade. <strong>Structured rosés</strong> from quality producers like Bandol's Mourvèdre-based wines or Champagne rosé can develop beautifully for 3-5 years, gaining complexity while maintaining freshness.</p>

<p><strong>Premium rosé Champagne</strong> represents the category's aging champion, with vintage bottlings from houses like Billecart-Salmon developing tertiary notes of brioche and honey over 8-12 years while retaining their signature elegance.</p>

<h3>Evolution and Peak Windows</h3>
<p>Young rosés showcase bright red fruit—strawberry, raspberry, watermelon—with pronounced floral notes. As they mature, these primary aromatics evolve into more complex profiles featuring dried herbs, subtle spice, and mineral undertones. The wine's texture typically softens as the phenolic structure integrates.</p>

<p>Most rosés should be consumed within their first vintage year for optimal fruit expression, though quality examples can maintain appeal through their second year when stored properly.</p>

<h3>Storage Requirements</h3>
<p>Store rosé at consistent <strong>50-55°F</strong> with 70% humidity, away from light and vibration. Unlike age-worthy reds, rosés benefit from slightly cooler storage to preserve their delicate fruit character. Keep bottles horizontal to maintain cork moisture.</p>

<h3>Aging vs. Spoilage</h3>
<p>Properly aged rosé develops honeyed notes and deeper color saturation while maintaining structural balance. <strong>Warning signs of decline</strong> include browning (beyond natural evolution), loss of fruit intensity, flat aromatics, or vinegar-like sharpness indicating bacterial spoilage. When in doubt, consume sooner rather than later—rosé's charm lies in its youthful vibrancy.</p>

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<div class="space-y-6">
  <div>
    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-wine-700 mb-2">What's the difference between dry and sweet rosé wines?</h3>
    <p class="text-gray-700">Dry rosés contain less than 4 grams of residual sugar per liter and showcase pure fruit flavors without sweetness, while sweet rosés like White Zinfandel can contain 15-45 grams per liter. The key indicator is the wine's origin - European rosés (Provence, Loire Valley, Spanish Rosado) are typically bone dry, whereas many American rosés lean toward off-dry or sweet. You can also check the alcohol level: dry rosés usually range from 11.5-13.5% ABV, while sweeter versions often fall below 11%.</p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-wine-700 mb-2">Should rosé wine be served ice-cold like white wine?</h3>
    <p class="text-gray-700">Rosé should be served chilled but not ice-cold - the ideal temperature is 45-50°F (7-10°C), slightly warmer than most white wines. Over-chilling mutes the delicate fruit flavors and aromatics that make rosé special, while serving it too warm emphasizes alcohol and can make it taste flabby. Remove the bottle from the refrigerator about 10-15 minutes before serving, or aim for the temperature of a well-chilled white Burgundy.</p>

    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-wine-700 mb-2">How long can you keep an opened bottle of rosé wine?</h3>
    <p class="text-gray-700">An opened bottle of rosé will maintain its fresh, crisp character for 3-5 days when properly stored in the refrigerator with a wine stopper or vacuum seal. Unlike red wines, rosé doesn't benefit from extended air exposure and will lose its vibrant fruit flavors quickly once oxidation begins. The high acidity in most rosés helps preserve them longer than low-acid wines, but delicate Provence-style rosés may start declining after just 2-3 days.</p>

    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-wine-700 mb-2">What's the best value rosé wine region for everyday drinking?</h3>
    <p class="text-gray-700">Loire Valley rosés, particularly Rosé d'Anjou and Cabernet d'Anjou, offer exceptional value with authentic French character at $12-18 per bottle. Spanish Rosado from regions like Navarra and Campo de Borja provide robust, food-friendly options at similar price points with more body than typical Provence styles. For domestic options, Washington State rosés deliver excellent quality-to-price ratios, often outperforming similarly priced California bottlings with better acidity and more refined fruit expression.</p>

    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibored text-wine-700 mb-2">Why does some rosé taste like candy while others taste bone dry?</h3>
    <p class="text-gray-700">The difference lies in winemaking technique and regional traditions - European rosés undergo complete fermentation converting all grape sugars to alcohol, while many American rosés are stopped mid-fermentation to retain residual sugar. Additionally, some producers add grape concentrate or use specific yeast strains that emphasize fruity esters, creating a "candied" perception even in technically dry wines. Grape variety also matters: Grenache and Cinsault create elegant, dry styles while White Zinfandel grapes naturally produce sweeter, more confected flavors.</p>

    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-wine-700 mb-2">Is rosé wine good for beginners who don't like red or white wine?</h3>
    <p class="text-gray-700">Rosé is perfect for wine beginners because it bridges the gap between whites and reds with approachable fruit flavors, moderate acidity, and no tannins to create astringency. The visual appeal and food versatility make it less intimidating than complex reds, while the dry styles offer more sophistication than sweet starter wines. Start with a Provence rosé or Spanish Rosado to experience the style at its most refined, then explore different grape varieties and regions to develop your palate.</p>

    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-wine-700 mb-2">What's the biggest mistake people make when buying rosé wine?</h3>
    <p class="text-gray-700">The biggest mistake is buying rosé from previous vintages - unlike red wines, rosé is meant to be consumed within 1-2 years of the vintage date to capture its fresh, vibrant character. Many retailers sell discounted older rosés that have lost their bright acidity and primary fruit flavors, leaving behind flat, oxidized wines that misrepresent the category. Always check the vintage date and choose the most recent year available, especially for delicate styles like Provence rosé.</p>

  <div>
    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-wine-700 mb-2">If I love Provence rosé, what similar wines should I try next?</h3>
    <p class="text-gray-700">Try Bandol rosé for a more structured, age-worthy expression from the same region, or explore Italian Chiaretto from Lake Garda for similar elegance with Italian terroir character. Sancerre rosé offers comparable minerality and finesse with Loire Valley typicity, while Austrian rosé (especially from Burgenland) provides the same dry, food-friendly profile with unique alpine fruit character. These alternatives maintain the sophisticated, pale-colored aesthetic and bone-dry style that makes Provence rosé so appealing.</p>
