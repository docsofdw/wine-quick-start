<h2>Origins & History</h2>

<p>Rosé wine's history spans millennia, with its origins tracing back to the ancient civilizations of the Mediterranean. The earliest rosé wines emerged naturally in regions like <strong>Provence, France</strong>, and the Greek islands around 600 BCE, where the light extraction methods used by ancient winemakers produced wines with subtle pink hues. These early rosés weren't intentional—they were simply the result of brief skin contact during fermentation.</p>

<p>The term "rosé" derives from the French word for pink, though the wine style predates the name by centuries. Ancient Greeks and Romans valued these pale wines for their refreshing qualities in warm climates. <strong>Provence</strong> became the spiritual home of rosé, where the region's unique terroir—limestone-rich soils, Mediterranean climate, and indigenous grape varieties like Grenache, Cinsault, and Mourvèdre—created the perfect conditions for this style.</p>

<h3>The Modern Renaissance</h3>

<p>Rosé experienced a remarkable transformation in the late 20th century. The 1970s saw a shift toward intentional production methods, with winemakers developing techniques like <strong>saignée</strong> (bleeding off pink juice from red wine fermentation) and direct pressing to create more refined expressions. Provence led this quality revolution, establishing strict AOC regulations in 1977 that emphasized pale color, dry style, and terroir expression.</p>

<p>The <strong>2000s marked rosé's global explosion</strong>, driven by changing consumer preferences toward lighter, food-friendly wines. Premium producers like Château d'Esclans with their "Whispering Angel" brand elevated rosé's reputation from summer novelty to year-round luxury. This period saw dramatic expansion beyond traditional regions, with successful rosé programs launching in California's Central Coast, Australia's Adelaide Hills, and Spain's Navarra.</p>

<p>Today, rosé represents one of wine's fastest-growing categories, with global consumption increasing 40% between 2010-2020. France remains the largest producer at 28% of world production, followed by Spain (18%) and the United States (11%). The style has evolved from ancient accident to modern precision, with <strong>temperature-controlled fermentation, selective harvesting, and innovative blending</strong> creating rosés of unprecedented quality and complexity across diverse terroirs worldwide.</p>

<h2>Grape Characteristics & Winemaking</h2>

<p>Rosé production begins with careful grape selection and precise timing, as winemakers must balance phenolic extraction with the delicate color and flavor profiles that define exceptional pink wines. Unlike red wine production, rosé requires restraint and technical precision to achieve the perfect balance of structure, freshness, and aromatic complexity.</p>

<h3>Viticulture and Harvest Considerations</h3>

<p>The best rosé grapes are typically harvested earlier than their red wine counterparts, maintaining higher acidity levels crucial for freshness and aging potential. <strong>Pinot Noir</strong> destined for rosé is often picked at 19-21° Brix, preserving the grape's natural elegance and bright red fruit characteristics. <strong>Grenache</strong> and <strong>Syrah</strong> in Provence are harvested at similar sugar levels, though the Mediterranean climate requires careful canopy management to prevent over-ripeness.</p>

<p>Yield management plays a critical role—while red wines often benefit from low yields, rosé production can handle moderate yields of 8-12 tons per acre without compromising quality. This higher yield actually helps maintain the lighter color intensity and crisp acidity that consumers expect from premium rosé.</p>

<h3>Winemaking Techniques</h3>

<p>Two primary methods dominate rosé production: <strong>direct press</strong> and <strong>saignée</strong> (bleeding). Direct press involves immediate pressing of red grapes, extracting minimal color from brief skin contact. This technique, favored in Provence, produces pale, elegant wines with pristine fruit flavors. Saignée, where juice is "bled off" from red wine tanks after 6-24 hours of skin contact, creates more intensely colored rosés with greater depth and complexity.</p>

<p>Temperature-controlled fermentation in stainless steel tanks at 55-65°F preserves delicate aromatics and prevents unwanted phenolic extraction. Most premium rosés avoid malolactic fermentation to maintain crisp acidity, though some Loire Valley producers allow partial MLF to add textural complexity. Oak aging is rare but not unheard of—Bandol rosés sometimes see brief barrel contact to add subtle spice notes without overwhelming the wine's inherent freshness.</p>

<h3>Regional Expression and Quality Indicators</h3>

<p><strong>Provence rosés</strong> showcase mineral-driven precision with pale salmon color and notes of white peach and Mediterranean herbs. <strong>Tavel</strong> produces fuller-bodied examples with deeper color and structured tannins. <strong>Loire Valley</strong> rosés from Sancerre and Chinon emphasize bright acidity and floral aromatics, while <strong>New World regions</strong> like Sonoma Coast create fruit-forward styles with excellent balance.</p>

<p>Quality indicators include brilliant clarity, appropriate color intensity for the style, vibrant acidity (typically 6-7 g/L), and clean, expressive aromatics free from reduction or oxidation. The finest rosés display seamless integration between fruit, acidity, and subtle mineral complexity.</p>

<h3>Aging Potential</h3>

<p>While most rosés are designed for immediate consumption within 2-3 years, exceptional examples from Bandol, Tavel, and premium Champagne rosés can evolve beautifully for 5-10 years, developing honeyed complexity while maintaining their essential freshness and vibrancy.</p>

<h2>What Does Rosé Wine Taste Like?</h2>

<h3>Appearance and Visual Cues</h3>
<p>Rosé wines display a captivating spectrum of pink hues, each telling a story about grape variety and production method. The lightest expressions, often called "onion skin" or <em>pelure d'oignon</em>, appear almost colorless with the faintest salmon tint—typical of Provence-style rosés made with minimal skin contact. Mid-range rosés showcase coral, watermelon, or rose petal tones, while deeper examples exhibit strawberry or even light cherry colors, indicating longer skin contact or darker grape varieties like Syrah or Cabernet Sauvignon.</p>

<p>The wine's viscosity, observed through "legs" or tears on the glass, reveals alcohol content and body. Premium rosés typically show moderate viscosity with clean, bright clarity that indicates careful filtration and quality winemaking.</p>

<h3>Aromatic Profile</h3>
<p class="bg-wine-50 p-4 rounded-lg">Quality rosé offers a compelling aromatic journey across three distinct categories. <strong>Primary aromas</strong> showcase fresh fruit expressions: wild strawberry, raspberry, white peach, citrus zest, and watermelon rind. Mediterranean herbs like thyme and rosemary often emerge, particularly in Provence examples.</p>

<p><strong>Secondary aromas</strong> from fermentation contribute subtle complexity—hints of fresh bread from lees contact, or delicate floral notes like rose petals and violet. <strong>Tertiary aromas</strong> in aged examples reveal honeyed notes, dried herbs, and subtle nuttiness, though most rosés are designed for immediate consumption.</p>

<h3>Palate and Texture</h3>
<p>The best rosés strike an elegant balance between refreshment and substance. Expect a <strong>light to medium body</strong> with crisp, mouthwatering acidity that provides structure and food-pairing versatility. Tannins remain minimal—just enough to add subtle grip without overwhelming the delicate fruit profile.</p>

<p>Alcohol typically ranges from 11.5-13.5%, providing warmth without heaviness. The texture should feel clean and refreshing, with a slight mineral backbone that speaks to terroir, particularly in examples from limestone-rich soils of Provence or volcanic soils of Santorini.</p>

<h3>Flavor Development and Finish</h3>
<p>On the palate, <strong>quality rosé</strong> reveals layers of red berry fruits—cranberry, strawberry, and cherry—often accompanied by citrus notes like pink grapefruit or blood orange. Mineral undertones provide complexity, while subtle spice notes of white pepper or pink peppercorn add intrigue.</p>

<p class="text-wine-700">The finish in premium examples extends beyond simple fruit, offering lingering minerality, herb-kissed salinity, and a clean, refreshing conclusion that invites the next sip. Look for rosés with at least 30-45 seconds of flavor persistence—a hallmark of serious winemaking and quality fruit sources.</p>

<h2>Origins & History</h2>

<p>Rosé wine's origins trace back to ancient civilizations, making it one of the world's oldest wine styles—predating both modern red and white winemaking techniques by millennia. Archaeological evidence suggests that the first wines produced in regions like <strong>Georgia, Armenia, and the eastern Mediterranean</strong> around 6000 BCE were naturally rosé in color, as ancient winemakers lacked the knowledge to extract deep color from grape skins.</p>

<p>The Greeks and Romans elevated rosé production throughout their empires, with <strong>Provence in southern France</strong> emerging as the style's spiritual homeland around 600 BCE when Greek settlers established vineyards near Marseille. The region's warm Mediterranean climate and limestone-rich soils proved ideal for producing the pale, dry rosés that would define the category. The name "rosé" itself derives from the Latin "rosatus," meaning "pinkish," though early French winemakers called these wines "clairet"—the etymological ancestor of the English word "claret."</p>

<h3>The Champagne Connection</h3>

<p>A pivotal moment came in the 17th century when <strong>Dom Pérignon and other Champagne producers</strong> began creating rosé Champagne through the saignée method—bleeding off pink juice from red grapes. This technique spread throughout France's wine regions, establishing rosé as a legitimate category rather than merely a winemaking accident.</p>

<h3>Modern Renaissance</h3>

<p>After declining in popularity during the mid-20th century due to association with sweet, mass-produced wines, rosé experienced a remarkable renaissance beginning in the 1990s. <strong>Provence producers like Domaines Ott and Château d'Esclans</strong> pioneered premium dry rosés that commanded serious prices and critical attention. The "Provence style"—bone-dry, pale salmon-colored wines with delicate fruit flavors—became the global gold standard.</p>

<p>Today, rosé represents one of wine's fastest-growing categories, with global consumption increasing by over 40% between 2002 and 2022. While France remains the largest producer at 7.5 million hectoliters annually, quality rosé production has expanded to <strong>Spain, Italy, California, Australia, and South Africa</strong>, each region developing distinctive styles that reflect their unique terroir and winemaking traditions.</p>

<h2>Grape Characteristics & Winemaking</h2>

<h3>The Foundation: Grape Selection and Viticulture</h3>

<p>Rosé production begins with strategic grape selection, as virtually any red grape variety can create exceptional pink wines. <strong>Pinot Noir</strong> thrives in cooler climates like Burgundy and Oregon, producing elegant rosés with bright acidity and delicate strawberry notes. The thin-skinned variety requires careful handling during harvest, typically picked in early morning to preserve freshness and prevent excessive color extraction.</p>

<p><strong>Grenache</strong>, the backbone of Provence rosés, demonstrates remarkable adaptability to Mediterranean climates. Its vigorous growth requires yield management—top producers limit yields to 35-40 hectoliters per hectare to concentrate flavors. The variety's thick skins provide controlled tannin extraction during brief skin contact periods of 2-12 hours.</p>

<p>Harvest timing proves crucial for rosé production. Grapes are picked earlier than for red wines, typically at 11-12% potential alcohol, preserving the bright acidity essential for refreshing rosé character while maintaining aromatic intensity.</p>

<h3>Winemaking Techniques: Precision in the Cellar</h3>

<p>Modern rosé production employs three primary methods: <strong>direct pressing</strong> (immediate separation of juice from skins), <strong>saignée</strong> (bleeding off juice from red wine fermentation), and <strong>skin contact</strong> (controlled maceration for 2-24 hours). Premium producers favor direct pressing or brief skin contact for precise color and flavor control.</p>

<p>Fermentation typically occurs in temperature-controlled stainless steel tanks at 55-65°F, preserving delicate aromatics and preventing excessive color development. Unlike many red wines, <strong>malolactic fermentation is generally avoided</strong> in rosé production to maintain crisp acidity and fresh fruit character, though some Loire Valley producers selectively employ partial MLF for added complexity.</p>

<h3>Regional Expression and Terroir</h3>

<p><strong>Provence rosés</strong> showcase mineral precision from limestone soils, expressing herbs de Provence alongside white peach and citrus. <strong>Bandol rosés</strong> from Mourvedre demonstrate greater structure and aging potential. <strong>Loire Valley Cabernet Franc</strong> rosés offer distinctive gooseberry and bell pepper notes, while <strong>Sancerre rosés</strong> from Pinot Noir display chalk-driven minerality.</p>

<h3>Quality Indicators and Aging Potential</h3>

<p>Premium rosés exhibit <strong>balanced acidity (6.5-7.5 g/L tartaric acid)</strong>, precise color intensity without browning, and complex aromatics beyond simple fruit. Quality indicators include clean fermentation character, appropriate alcohol levels (11.5-13.5%), and seamless integration of all components.</p>

<p>While most rosés are designed for immediate consumption, exceptional examples from <strong>Bandol, Tavel, and premium Champagne rosés</strong> can develop beautifully for 3-8 years. These wines evolve from bright fruit flavors toward more complex notes of dried herbs, honey, and mineral complexity while maintaining their essential freshness through balanced acidity.</p>

<h2>What Does Rosé Wine Taste Like?</h2>

<div class="bg-wine-50 p-6 rounded-lg">

<h3 class="text-wine-700 mb-4">Appearance and Visual Clues</h3>

<p>Rosé wines display a stunning spectrum of hues, from the palest salmon-pink of Provence styles to the deeper coral and onion-skin tones of Bandol or Tavel. The color intensity often correlates with production method—<strong>saignée</strong> (bleeding method) rosés typically show deeper pigmentation than direct-press versions. Young rosés exhibit brilliant clarity with vibrant, jewel-like transparency, while older examples may develop subtle amber or copper undertones around the rim, indicating bottle age and potential oxidation.</p>

<h3 class="text-wine-700 mb-4">Aromatic Profile</h3>

<p>Quality rosé wines offer layered aromatics that evolve in the glass. <strong>Primary fruit aromas</strong> dominate young examples: fresh strawberries, wild raspberries, white peach, and watermelon in delicate styles, progressing to red currant, cherry, and pink grapefruit in more structured wines. <strong>Secondary fermentation notes</strong> contribute subtle yeasty complexity, particularly in traditional method sparkling rosés, while some producers employ brief lees contact for added texture and brioche-like nuances.</p>

<p>Premium aged rosés develop <strong>tertiary characteristics</strong>—dried rose petals, orange zest, honey, and subtle spice notes that add sophisticated complexity without overwhelming the wine's inherent freshness.</p>

<h3 class="text-wine-700 mb-4">Palate Structure and Mouthfeel</h3>

<p>Most rosés present light to medium body with crisp, mouthwatering acidity that provides the backbone for food pairing versatility. Tannins remain minimal but perceptible in structured examples like Bandol or serious Spanish rosados, offering gentle grip without astringency. Alcohol levels typically range from 11.5-13.5%, contributing to the wine's refreshing character while maintaining adequate weight.</p>

<p>The texture varies from ethereally light Provence styles to more substantial examples with brief skin maceration, creating subtle phenolic texture that enhances complexity without compromising drinkability.</p>

<h3 class="text-wine-700 mb-4">Flavor Development and Finish</h3>

<p>On the palate, expect bright red berry fruits complemented by citrus zest, subtle herbs (thyme, rosemary), and mineral undertones reflecting terroir—chalky limestone in Champagne rosé, garrigue herbs in Provence, or saline minerality in coastal regions. Quality examples show flavor persistence and integration, with a clean, refreshing finish that invites the next sip.</p>

<p><strong>Premium quality markers</strong> include balanced fruit-acid harmony, complex aromatic layers, elegant mouthfeel, and a finish that extends beyond simple fruit flavors to include subtle spice, mineral, or floral notes that speak to terroir and careful winemaking.</p>

  <h2>Expert Tips</h2>
<ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-4 text-gray-700">
  <li><strong>Master the Color-Quality Connection</strong> - The hue of rosé wine directly reflects its production method and grape contact time. Pale salmon-pink rosés (like Provence style) typically come from brief skin contact or saignée method, offering delicate red fruit notes. Deeper coral or cherry-tinted rosés often use direct press or longer maceration, delivering more intensity. Avoid rosés with brown or orange tinges—these indicate oxidation or over-aging, common mistakes in rosé production.</li>

  <li><strong>Serve at the Perfect 50-55°F Sweet Spot</strong> - Rosé wine demands precise temperature control between 50-55°F (10-13°C)—warmer than white wine but cooler than red. This temperature preserves the wine's fresh acidity while allowing subtle red fruit aromatics to emerge. Too cold (below 45°F) and you'll mute the wine's complexity; too warm (above 60°F) and the alcohol becomes prominent, masking rosé's characteristic elegance. Use an ice bucket with half ice, half water for 15 minutes to achieve ideal serving temperature.</li>

  <li><strong>Skip the Decanter—Rosé Needs Immediate Enjoyment</strong> - Unlike red wines, rosé should never be decanted or allowed to breathe extensively. The wine's primary charm lies in its fresh, primary fruit aromatics and crisp acidity, which dissipate quickly upon exposure to air. Pour rosé directly from bottle to glass, and consume within 2-3 hours of opening. The exception: very young, high-quality rosés from producers like Domaine Tempier may benefit from 15 minutes of gentle aeration to soften any residual tannins.</li>

  <li><strong>Choose White Wine Glasses for Optimal Expression</strong> - Serve rosé in medium-sized white wine glasses with a slightly tapered rim—never use red wine glasses. The smaller bowl concentrates the delicate aromatics (strawberry, peach, herbs) that define quality rosé, while the tapered opening directs these subtle scents to your nose. Avoid wide-bowled glasses that dissipate rosé's nuanced bouquet. Brands like Riedel's Vinum Riesling/Sauvignon Blanc glasses perfectly showcase rosé's characteristics.</li>

  <li><strong>Understand the 18-Month Consumption Window</strong> - Most rosé wines reach peak drinking quality within 6-18 months of vintage date and should never be aged beyond two years. The wine's appeal centers on vibrant fruit flavors and refreshing acidity that fade over time. However, exceptional rosés from Bandol (Mourvèdre-based) or Tavel can develop for 3-5 years, gaining complexity while maintaining their core freshness. Check vintage dates religiously—avoid any rosé older than two years unless specifically designed for aging.</li>

  <li><strong>Recognize Seasonal Drinking Patterns for Peak Enjoyment</strong> - Rosé wine follows a unique consumption calendar: drink light, Provence-style rosés during spring and summer (March-September) when their crisp, refreshing qualities shine. Reserve fuller-bodied rosés from regions like Navarra or Languedoc for early fall (September-November) when their greater structure complements transitional weather. Winter rosé consumption should focus on richer styles with more red fruit intensity, such as rosé Champagne or Sancerre rosé.</li>

  <li><strong>Identify Quality Through the "Mineral-Fruit Balance"</strong> - Premium rosé wines exhibit a distinctive balance between mineral tension and fruit expression. Look for wines with bright acidity that creates a "saline" or "chalky" backbone supporting red fruit flavors—this indicates quality terroir and careful winemaking. Inferior rosés show simple fruit without mineral complexity or, conversely, harsh acidity without sufficient fruit integration. Taste for this balance in renowned regions: Provence (garrigue herbs), Sancerre (Loire river stones), or Bandol (Mediterranean limestone).</li>

  <li><strong>Master Food Pairing Through Rosé's Unique Flavor Bridge</strong> - Rosé wine's greatest strength lies in its ability to bridge white and red wine pairing principles. Its red fruit character complements salmon, duck, and charcuterie, while its acidity cuts through rich cheeses and creamy sauces like traditional white wines. The key insight: match rosé intensity to dish weight. Light Provence rosés pair with seafood and salads; medium-bodied Spanish rosados complement grilled meats; full-bodied Bandol rosés handle spicy cuisines and aged cheeses.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Aging & Cellaring</h2>

<p>Most rosé wines are crafted for immediate enjoyment, but understanding their aging potential can enhance your drinking experience. The majority of rosés, including Provence classics and New World styles, reach their peak within <strong>1-3 years of vintage</strong>, when their bright acidity and fresh fruit flavors remain vibrant.</p>

<h3>Quality Levels and Aging Potential</h3>

<p>Entry-level rosés should be consumed within 18 months, while premium bottlings from producers like Domaine Tempier or Château d'Esclans can evolve beautifully for 3-5 years. <strong>Champagne rosé and quality Crémant rosé</strong> can age gracefully for 5-10 years, developing toasty complexity while maintaining their elegant structure.</p>

<h3>How Rosé Evolves</h3>

<p>As rosé ages, the initial strawberry and citrus notes gradually shift toward more complex flavors of dried herbs, white pepper, and subtle nuttiness. The wine's vibrant pink hue naturally fades to salmon or onion-skin tones—this is normal evolution, not spoilage. Well-made rosés with higher acidity, like those from Sancerre or Bandol, develop <strong>mineral complexity</strong> while retaining freshness.</p>

<h3>Proper Storage Requirements</h3>

<p>Store rosé at a consistent <strong>50-55°F (10-13°C)</strong> with 70% humidity. Keep bottles on their side to maintain cork moisture, away from direct light and vibration. Unlike reds, rosés are particularly sensitive to temperature fluctuations, which can accelerate unwanted oxidation.</p>

<h3>Recognizing Proper Aging vs. Spoilage</h3>

<p>Properly aged rosé maintains clean aromatics with evolved complexity. Warning signs of spoilage include: brown or orange discoloration beyond normal evolution, vinegar-like aromas, or flat, lifeless flavors. A slight color fade is expected, but the wine should still smell fresh and taste balanced, even as primary fruit gives way to tertiary development.</p>

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<div class="space-y-6">
  <div>
    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-wine-700 mb-2">What's the difference between dry and sweet rosé wines?</h3>
    <p class="text-gray-700">Dry rosé wines contain less than 4 grams of residual sugar per liter and showcase crisp, mineral-driven flavors with bright acidity. Sweet rosé wines, often labeled as "off-dry" or "demi-sec," contain 12-45 grams of residual sugar per liter and display softer, fruit-forward characteristics. The majority of premium rosé wines from Provence, Loire Valley, and quality producers worldwide are made in the dry style, while sweeter versions are more common in commercial American brands.</p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-wine-700 mb-2">How do I choose a quality rosé wine at different price points?</h3>
    <p class="text-gray-700">At $15-25, look for rosé from established regions like Provence, Loire Valley, or quality producers in Washington State and California's Central Coast. Mid-range options ($25-40) include single-vineyard Bandol rosé or premium Sancerre rosé with greater complexity and aging potential. For everyday drinking under $15, seek out Spanish Garnacha rosé from Campo de Borja or Portuguese rosé from Vinho Verde, which offer excellent value and authentic regional character.</p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibeled text-wine-700 mb-2">Should rosé wine be served ice-cold like white wine?</h3>
    <p class="text-gray-700">Rosé should be served chilled at 45-50°F (7-10°C), slightly warmer than most white wines but cooler than reds. Serving too cold (below 40°F) masks the wine's delicate fruit flavors and aromatics, while serving too warm emphasizes alcohol and diminishes refreshment. Remove the bottle from the refrigerator 10-15 minutes before serving, or chill for 2-3 hours if starting at room temperature.</p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-wine-700 mb-2">Can rosé wine be aged, or should it always be consumed young?</h3>
    <p class="text-gray-700">Most rosé wines are designed for immediate consumption within 1-2 years of the vintage date to preserve their fresh, vibrant character. However, premium rosé from regions like Bandol, Tavel, or high-end Champagne rosé can develop beautifully over 3-5 years, gaining complexity and deeper flavors. The key is distinguishing between everyday rosé (drink young) and structured, full-bodied rosé with sufficient tannins and acidity for aging.</p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-wine-700 mb-2">What are the most common mistakes when buying rosé wine?</h3>
    <p class="text-gray-700">The biggest mistake is choosing rosé based on color intensity, assuming darker equals better or more flavorful—when actually, the best rosé often displays pale salmon or onion-skin hues. Another error is buying rosé that's more than two years old unless it's specifically a premium age-worthy style. Many consumers also overlook the vintage date entirely, not realizing that rosé's charm lies in its youthful freshness and bright acidity.</p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-wine-700 mb-2">Is rosé wine a good choice for wine beginners?</h3>
    <p class="text-gray-700">Rosé is an excellent entry point for new wine drinkers because it bridges the gap between white and red wines with moderate complexity and food-friendly acidity. The approachable fruit flavors—strawberry, watermelon, and citrus—are easily recognizable, while the wine's versatility with food helps build confidence in pairing. Quality dry rosé also teaches beginners to appreciate balance and finesse over power, establishing a foundation for exploring other wine styles.</p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-wine-700 mb-2">What are the best alternatives to expensive Provence rosé?</h3>
    <p class="text-gray-700">Spanish rosé from Navarra offers similar pale color and mineral-driven character at half the price of Provence. Italian rosato from Puglia or Marche provides excellent value with slightly more body and fruit intensity. For domestic options, rosé from Virginia's Monticello AVA or Oregon's Willamette Valley delivers comparable elegance and food-pairing versatility without the premium markup of imported French wines.</p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-wine-700 mb-2">How long does an opened bottle of rosé wine stay fresh?</h3>
    <p class="text-gray-700">An opened bottle of rosé will maintain its best qualities for 3-5 days when stored in the refrigerator with a proper wine stopper or vacuum seal. The wine's bright acidity and lower tannin structure make it more susceptible to oxidation than red wines, so it's best consumed sooner rather than later. After the fifth day, while still safe to drink, the wine will lose its characteristic freshness and vibrant fruit flavors that make rosé so appealing.</p>
