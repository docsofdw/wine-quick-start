  <h2>Understanding Sonoma Wine</h2>
  <p>When it comes to sonoma wine, quality matters more than price. Our team of sommeliers has tasted hundreds of options to bring you these expert recommendations.</p>

<h2>History & Origins of Sonoma Wine</h2>

<p>Sonoma County's winemaking legacy began in 1812 when Russian settlers at Fort Ross planted the first commercial vineyards along California's North Coast. However, the region's true viticultural foundation was established by Hungarian nobleman <strong>Agoston Haraszthy</strong>, known as the "Father of California Viticulture," who founded Buena Vista Winery in 1857 and imported over 100,000 European vine cuttings, fundamentally transforming Sonoma's grape growing potential.</p>

<p>The late 19th century marked Sonoma's golden age, with Italian immigrant families like the Sebastianis (1904) and Foppiano (1896) establishing generational wineries that remain cornerstones of the region today. The <strong>Kunde family</strong> began farming in 1904, while <strong>Gundlach Bundschu</strong>, California's oldest continuously family-owned winery, survived both the 1906 San Francisco earthquake and Prohibition by selling grapes to home winemakers.</p>

<p>Prohibition (1920-1933) devastated Sonoma's wine industry, with many vineyards converted to prune orchards or abandoned entirely. The region's renaissance began in the 1960s when pioneering vintners like <strong>Joe Swan</strong> and <strong>Tom Dehlinger</strong> recognized Sonoma's exceptional terroir for Pinot Noir and Chardonnay, particularly in the cool Russian River Valley.</p>

<h3>Modern Recognition and Classification</h3>

<p>The establishment of <strong>Russian River Valley AVA</strong> in 1983 marked Sonoma's entry into formal wine region classification, followed by Sonoma Coast AVA (1987) and Alexander Valley AVA (1984). Today, Sonoma County encompasses 18 distinct American Viticultural Areas, each with unique microclimates and soil compositions.</p>

<p>The region gained international acclaim in the 1970s and 1980s as quality-focused producers like <strong>Williams Selyem</strong>, <strong>Kosta Browne</strong>, and <strong>Rochioli</strong> demonstrated that Sonoma's diverse terroir could produce world-class wines rivaling Burgundy and Bordeaux. Modern Sonoma represents over 60,000 acres of vineyards across 425 wineries, with sustainable farming practices and innovative winemaking techniques cementing its reputation as one of California's premier wine regions.</p>

<h2>Terroir & Climate</h2>

<h3>Climate Dynamics</h3>
<p>Sonoma County's complex climate is defined by its proximity to the Pacific Ocean and the dramatic interplay between coastal fog and inland heat. The region experiences a <strong>Mediterranean climate</strong> with warm, dry summers averaging 75-85°F during the day, dropping to 45-55°F at night—a diurnal temperature swing crucial for maintaining acidity in grapes. Annual rainfall ranges from 25-45 inches, concentrated in winter months, while growing season sunshine averages 2,800 hours annually. Vintage variation is significant: cooler years like 2010 and 2011 produced wines with bright acidity and elegant structure, while warmer vintages such as 2014 and 2015 yielded more concentrated, powerful expressions.</p>

<h3>Diverse Soil Composition</h3>
<p>Sonoma's geological complexity stems from tectonic activity and ancient seabeds. <strong>Goldridge soils</strong> dominate the western regions, offering excellent drainage through sandy loam that stresses vines beneficially, concentrating flavors in Pinot Noir and Chardonnay. The Mayacamas Mountains contribute <strong>volcanic ash and red clay</strong>, particularly around Glen Ellen and Kenwood, imparting mineral complexity and firm tannin structure to Cabernet Sauvignon. <strong>Franciscan shale and sandstone</strong> in areas like Dry Creek Valley provide good water retention, supporting the herbaceous complexity found in exceptional Sauvignon Blanc. Alluvial gravel deposits along creek beds, especially in Alexander Valley, create well-draining conditions that produce Cabernet Sauvignon with cassis intensity and graphite minerality.</p>

<h3>Geographic Influence</h3>
<p>Elevations range from sea level along the Sonoma Coast to 2,663 feet atop Mount St. Helena. <strong>Hillside vineyards</strong> between 400-1,200 feet, such as those on Sonoma Mountain, benefit from superior drainage and sun exposure, yielding wines with concentrated fruit and structured tannins. South-facing slopes capture maximum solar radiation, while north-facing sites remain cooler, preserving acidity. Key geographic zones include the fog-cooled <strong>Petaluma Gap</strong>, where Chardonnay develops citrus precision and mineral tension, and the warmer <strong>Knights Valley</strong>, where Cabernet Sauvignon achieves full phenolic ripeness while retaining freshness.</p>

<h3>Microclimate Factors</h3>
<p>The <strong>Russian River</strong> acts as a fog conduit, channeling marine air inland through the Petaluma Gap, creating cooling effects that extend 15-20 miles from the coast. This fog burn-off pattern creates distinct microclimates: vineyards closer to the river experience cooler conditions producing wines with bright red fruit and earthy undertones, while sites just miles away develop richer, darker fruit characteristics. The <strong>Mayacamas and Sonoma Mountains</strong> create rain shadows and thermal protection, allowing extended hang time that develops complex secondary flavors—leather, tobacco, and dried herbs—particularly evident in premium Cabernet Sauvignon from Bennett Valley and Sonoma Valley floor sites.</p>

<h2>What Does Sonoma Wine Taste Like?</h2>

<div class="bg-wine-50 p-6 rounded-lg mb-6">
<p>Sonoma County's diverse microclimates and soil types create wines with remarkable complexity and terroir expression. From the fog-kissed Pinot Noirs of the Russian River Valley to the powerful Cabernets of Alexander Valley, each bottle tells the story of its specific vineyard site.</p>
</div>

<h3>Appearance and Structure</h3>
<p>Sonoma reds typically display deep, saturated colors ranging from ruby garnet in Pinot Noir to inky purple-black in Cabernet Sauvignon. Premium examples show excellent <strong>concentration</strong> with viscous legs that indicate higher alcohol and glycerol content—a hallmark of Sonoma's warm days and cool nights. White wines range from pale straw (Sauvignon Blanc) to golden yellow (barrel-aged Chardonnay), often with brilliant clarity that reflects careful winemaking.</p>

<h3>Aromatic Complexity</h3>
<p>The nose reveals Sonoma's signature intensity. <strong>Primary aromas</strong> include ripe blackberry and cassis in Cabernet Sauvignon, cherry and raspberry in Pinot Noir, and tropical guava and passion fruit in Sauvignon Blanc. <strong>Secondary fermentation notes</strong> contribute vanilla and spice from American oak aging, plus subtle yeasty complexity from lees stirring in premium Chardonnays. <strong>Tertiary aging aromas</strong> develop into leather, tobacco, forest floor, and cedar—particularly notable in Sonoma's age-worthy Bordeaux blends.</p>

<h3>Palate and Texture</h3>
<p>Sonoma wines exhibit <strong>full body</strong> with balanced acidity that provides freshness despite the region's warmth. Reds show velvety tannins that are ripe and integrated, avoiding the harsh green notes of cooler climates. Alcohol typically runs 14-15% ABV but remains well-integrated in quality examples. The <strong>mouthfeel</strong> is rich and concentrated, with a silky texture that coats the palate.</p>

<h3>Flavor Profile</h3>
<p>Expect layers of <strong>dark fruit flavors</strong>—plum, blackberry, and boysenberry—complemented by warm spices like cinnamon, clove, and black pepper. Sonoma's volcanic soils contribute distinctive <strong>mineral notes</strong> of graphite and wet stone, while the marine influence adds subtle herbal qualities of sage and dried Mediterranean herbs. Premium bottlings show complex <strong>tertiary flavors</strong> of dark chocolate, espresso, and exotic spices.</p>

<h3>Finish and Quality Markers</h3>
<p>Outstanding Sonoma wines deliver a <strong>long, persistent finish</strong> lasting 30+ seconds, with evolving flavors that reveal new complexity. Look for <strong>seamless integration</strong> between fruit, oak, and tannins, plus the ability to improve with 5-15 years of cellaring. The best examples show <strong>site-specific character</strong>—whether Russian River Valley's elegance or Dry Creek Valley's rustic power—that clearly expresses their unique terroir.</p>

<h2>History & Origins of Sonoma County</h2>

<p>Sonoma County's winemaking heritage traces back to the early 19th century, beginning with the mission period when Franciscan monks planted the region's first vines around 1812 at Mission San Francisco Solano in the town of Sonoma. However, the true foundation of Sonoma's modern wine industry emerged in the 1850s when Hungarian immigrant <strong>Count Agoston Haraszthy</strong> established Buena Vista Winery in 1857, earning him recognition as the "Father of California Viticulture."</p>

<p>Haraszthy's revolutionary approach included importing over 100,000 vine cuttings from Europe, introducing noble grape varieties like Zinfandel to California soil. His pioneering efforts established Sonoma as a serious winemaking region decades before Napa Valley gained prominence. The late 1800s saw the arrival of other influential families, including the <strong>Gundlach-Bundschu family</strong> (1858) and <strong>Sebastiani family</strong> (1904), whose legacies continue today.</p>

<p>Prohibition (1920-1933) devastated Sonoma's wine industry, but the region experienced a renaissance beginning in the 1960s. Visionary winemakers like <strong>Joe Swan</strong> in Russian River Valley pioneered cool-climate Pinot Noir production, while <strong>Jordan Vineyard & Winery</strong> (established 1972) elevated Sonoma's reputation for Bordeaux-style wines.</p>

<h3>Official Recognition and Modern Status</h3>

<p>Sonoma County achieved federal recognition through a series of American Viticultural Area (AVA) designations, beginning with <strong>Sonoma Valley AVA in 1981</strong>, followed by Russian River Valley AVA (1983), and eventually encompassing 18 distinct AVAs within the broader Sonoma County AVA (established 1987). Each designation recognizes unique microclimates, soil compositions, and growing conditions that define terroir-driven winemaking.</p>

<p>Today, Sonoma County encompasses over 60,000 acres of vineyards across diverse geographical zones, from the fog-cooled Russian River Valley perfect for Pinot Noir and Chardonnay, to the warmer Alexander Valley ideal for Cabernet Sauvignon. With more than 400 wineries and a reputation for sustainable farming practices—over 99% of vineyard acreage is certified sustainable—Sonoma has established itself as California's most environmentally conscious wine region while maintaining its position as a world-class producer of premium wines.</p>

<h2>Terroir & Climate</h2>

<h3>Climate Dynamics</h3>
<p>Sonoma County's Mediterranean climate creates ideal conditions for premium viticulture, with warm, dry summers averaging 75-85°F during the day and cool nights dropping to 45-55°F. This dramatic diurnal temperature variation—often exceeding 40°F—preserves crucial acidity while allowing phenolic development. Annual rainfall ranges from 25-60 inches depending on location, concentrated in winter months, while vineyards bask in over 2,800 hours of annual sunshine. Vintage variation is significant: 2020's extreme heat spikes contrasted sharply with 2011's cool, extended growing season, demonstrating how climate fluctuations shape wine style from rich and concentrated to elegant and mineral-driven.</p>

<h3>Diverse Soil Profiles</h3>
<p>Sonoma's geological complexity rivals Burgundy, with over 100 soil types influencing wine character. The <strong>Goldridge sandy loam</strong> of the Russian River Valley promotes elegant Pinot Noir with bright red fruit and silky tannins, while the <strong>volcanic ash soils</strong> of Bennett Valley create structured wines with distinctive mineral backbone. <strong>Franciscan mélange</strong>—a mixture of sandstone, shale, and serpentine—dominates Sonoma Mountain, producing Cabernet Sauvignon with firm tannins and earthy complexity. The <strong>alluvial gravel deposits</strong> near riverbeds provide excellent drainage, concentrating flavors and creating wines with intense color and robust structure. Clay-rich soils in cooler areas retain moisture, supporting late-ripening varieties like Sangiovese with their characteristic bright acidity and herbal notes.</p>

<h3>Geographic Influences</h3>
<p>Elevation changes from sea level to 2,600 feet create distinct mesoclimates within Sonoma's 1,768 square miles. <strong>Sonoma Mountain</strong> vineyards above 1,000 feet experience cooler temperatures and increased UV exposure, producing Cabernet Sauvignon with concentrated dark fruit and firm tannin structure. South-facing slopes capture maximum sun exposure, ideal for Bordeaux varieties, while north-facing aspects favor cool-climate grapes like Chardonnay and Pinot Noir. The <strong>Mayacamas Mountains</strong> create a rain shadow effect, while <strong>Sonoma Valley's</strong> bowl shape channels cool air, moderating temperatures for balanced acidity.</p>

<h3>Microclimate Factors</h3>
<p>The <strong>Russian River</strong> acts as a natural air conditioner, channeling Pacific fog inland through the Petaluma Gap, creating morning mist that burns off by midday. This marine influence keeps western areas 10-15°F cooler than inland regions, perfect for Burgundian varieties. <strong>San Pablo Bay</strong> funnels cool air northward, while the <strong>Mayacamas and Sonoma Mountains</strong> create wind patterns that reduce disease pressure and concentrate flavors. These microclimates translate directly to wine character: fog-influenced Chardonnays show crisp green apple and citrus notes with mineral tension, while protected valley floor Zinfandels develop rich blackberry intensity with spicy complexity.</p>

<h2>What Does Sonoma Wine Taste Like?</h2>

<p>Sonoma County's diverse microclimates and soil types create wines with remarkable complexity and distinctive regional character. The tasting profile varies significantly based on the specific appellation, grape variety, and winemaking approach, but certain hallmarks define the Sonoma experience.</p>

<h3>Appearance and Visual Cues</h3>

<p>Sonoma Pinot Noirs typically display a translucent ruby to garnet hue with moderate viscosity, indicating balanced alcohol levels around 13.5-14.5%. Premium examples show brilliant clarity with subtle rim variation that hints at complexity. Sonoma Chardonnays range from pale straw in cooler appellations like Russian River Valley to deeper gold in warmer regions, with noticeable glycerol legs suggesting rich texture and often some oak influence.</p>

<h3>Aromatic Complexity</h3>

<p>The nose reveals Sonoma's terroir-driven character through distinct aromatic layers. **Primary fruit aromas** in reds include bright red cherry, wild strawberry, and raspberry from coastal vineyards, while inland sites produce darker blackberry and plum notes. White wines showcase citrus zest, green apple, and stone fruit depending on location.</p>

<p>**Secondary fermentation aromas** contribute complexity through subtle yeast-derived notes—think brioche in barrel-fermented Chardonnays or earthy mushroom undertones in wild-fermented Pinot Noirs. **Tertiary aging aromas** in premium bottles reveal forest floor, dried herbs, vanilla bean, and distinctive Sonoma signatures like eucalyptus and sage brush from the region's Mediterranean climate.</p>

<h3>Palate and Texture</h3>

<p>Sonoma wines exhibit medium to full body with vibrant acidity that reflects the county's cooling Pacific influence. Red wines show refined tannins—structured yet supple in quality examples—with alcohol well-integrated rather than hot. The texture often displays a distinctive silky mouthfeel, particularly in Russian River Valley Pinot Noirs and Alexander Valley Cabernets.</p>

<p>**Flavor profiles** mirror the aromatics but intensify: coastal Pinot Noirs deliver precise red fruit with earthy minerality, while Alexander Valley Cabernets provide cassis, dark chocolate, and tobacco leaf. Sonoma Chardonnays balance tropical fruit flavors with citrus acidity and often show subtle oak spice without overwhelming the fruit.</p>

<h3>Finish and Quality Markers</h3>

<p>Premium Sonoma wines demonstrate **extended finishes**—30 seconds or more—with evolving flavors that reveal new complexities. Quality markers include seamless integration of oak, alcohol, and acidity; persistent mineral notes reflecting specific soil types; and the ability to improve with proper cellaring. The best examples show restraint and elegance over power, embodying Sonoma's sophisticated winemaking philosophy.</p>

  <h2>Food Pairing Guide</h2>

<p>Sonoma's diverse terroir produces wines that create exceptional <strong>flavor bridges</strong> with food through their characteristic bright acidity, mineral backbone, and expressive fruit profiles.

<h2>Expert Tips</h2>
<ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-4 text-gray-700">
  <li><strong>Master the AVA Distinctions for Smart Selection</strong> - Sonoma's 18 sub-AVAs produce dramatically different wines. Russian River Valley Pinot Noir shows bright cherry and earth from cool marine fog, while Alexander Valley Cabernet offers structured blackberry with dusty tannins from warmer valley floors. Always check the specific AVA on the label—a Dry Creek Valley Zinfandel will deliver spicy intensity that's completely different from a cooler Sonoma Coast version.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Serve Sonoma Pinot Noir Slightly Warmer</strong> - Unlike Burgundy, serve Sonoma Pinot Noir at 62-65°F rather than the standard 55-60°F. The region's riper fruit profile and higher alcohol (typically 14-15%) needs that extra warmth to fully express its characteristic cola spice, dried herbs, and silky texture. This is especially true for Russian River and Sonoma Coast bottlings.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Decant Young Sonoma Cabernet for 2-3 Hours</strong> - Sonoma's mountain Cabernets from Moon Mountain and Sonoma Mountain AVAs are notoriously tight when young due to high tannin extraction from thin mountain soils. Unlike Napa's opulent style, these wines need extended decanting to soften their austere structure and reveal underlying cassis and graphite minerality.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Use Larger Bowls for Sonoma Chardonnay</strong> - Sonoma's diverse Chardonnay styles—from crisp, mineral-driven Sonoma Coast to rich, oak-aged Russian River—benefit from generous bowl glasses (20+ oz Burgundy stems). The wider surface area helps integrate the characteristic green apple acidity with complex lees aging flavors, especially important for producers like Kistler and Peter Michael who employ extended sur lie aging.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Age Sonoma Zinfandel 3-7 Years Maximum</strong> - Unlike other varietals, Sonoma Zinfandel (particularly from Dry Creek Valley's old vines) peaks relatively early due to its naturally lower acid structure. The region's warm days create jammy fruit that's best enjoyed while the bright berry flavors remain vibrant, before they fade to pruney overripeness that can occur after 8-10 years.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Drink Sonoma Coast Wines Within Their Vintage Window</strong> - The extreme coastal influence creates wines with high natural acidity but delicate aromatic compounds. Sonoma Coast Pinot Noir and Chardonnay are best consumed within 5-8 years to capture their signature ocean breeze minerality and bright citrus-driven acidity before these ethereal characteristics diminish.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Look for "Estate" Designations from Historic Producers</strong> - Sonoma's legacy wineries like Buena Vista (founded 1857) and Sebastiani offer exceptional value in estate-grown wines. These producers have decades of site-specific knowledge and established vineyard blocks that produce more consistent, terroir-driven wines than their purchased-fruit bottlings, often at only 20-30% price premiums.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Match Food Pairing to Sonoma's Mediterranean Climate Influence</strong> - Sonoma wines naturally pair with Mediterranean-style cuisine due to shared climate conditions. The region's characteristic herb undertones (rosemary, thyme, sage) in reds, and mineral-driven whites complement olive oil-based dishes, grilled vegetables, and herb-crusted proteins better than the richer, more opulent Napa styles that need heartier fare.</li>
</ol>



  <h2>Aging & Cellaring</h2>

<p>Sonoma's diverse terroir produces wines with varying aging potential, from immediate-drinking Pinot Noirs to age-worthy Cabernet Sauvignons that develop magnificently over decades.</p>

<h3>Aging Potential by Style</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Premium Cabernet Sauvignon</strong> (Alexander Valley, Knights Valley): 15-25 years peak aging</li>
<li><strong>Russian River Pinot Noir</strong>: 8-12 years for top producers like Williams Selyem</li>
<li><strong>Dry Creek Zinfandel</strong>: 10-15 years for concentrated, well-structured examples</li>
<li><strong>Sonoma Coast Chardonnay</strong>: 5-10 years for mineral-driven, age-worthy styles</li>
</ul>

<h3>Evolution Over Time</h3>
<p>Sonoma Cabernet Sauvignon transforms dramatically during cellaring. Young wines display intense cassis and eucalyptus notes with firm tannins. After 5-7 years, secondary flavors emerge—leather, tobacco, and cedar from oak integration. Peak maturity brings tertiary complexity: forest floor, graphite, and integrated fruit with silky tannins.</p>

<p>Russian River Pinot Noir evolves from bright cherry and cola to earthy mushroom and truffle notes, while maintaining its signature silky texture. The region's cool climate preserves acidity essential for graceful aging.</p>

<h3>Optimal Storage Conditions</h3>
<div class="bg-wine-50 p-4 rounded-lg">
<ul>
<li><strong>Temperature</strong>: 55-58°F consistent (Sonoma's temperature swings make controlled storage crucial)</li>
<li><strong>Humidity</strong>: 60-70% to prevent cork drying</li>
<li><strong>Position</strong>: Bottles horizontal for cork contact</li>
<li><strong>Light</strong>: Complete darkness to prevent UV degradation</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h3>Aging vs. Spoilage Indicators</h3>
<p><strong>Proper aging</strong> shows clear wine with sediment formation, evolved aromatics, and balanced acidity. <strong>Spoilage signs</strong> include cloudy appearance, vinegar-like aromas, or excessive oxidation (sherry-like notes in red wines). Sonoma's high-quality corks typically maintain integrity for 15+ years when properly stored, though vintage variation affects longevity—exceptional years like 2013 and 2016 show extended aging potential.</p>

<h2>Aging & Cellaring</h2>

<p>Sonoma's diverse terroir produces wines with varying aging potential, from immediate-drinking Pinot Noirs to decades-worthy Cabernet Sauvignons. Understanding each wine's evolution timeline maximizes your cellar investment.</p>

<h3>Aging Potential by Style</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Russian River Valley Pinot Noir</strong>: 3-8 years, with premium single-vineyard bottlings reaching 10-12 years</li>
<li><strong>Sonoma Coast Chardonnay</strong>: 2-6 years for most, though top producers like Kistler can develop for 8-10 years</li>
<li><strong>Alexander Valley Cabernet Sauvignon</strong>: 8-20 years, with structured examples from Jordan or Silver Oak aging gracefully for decades</li>
<li><strong>Dry Creek Valley Zinfandel</strong>: 5-12 years, depending on extraction levels and vineyard site</li>
</ul>

<h3>Evolution Patterns</h3>

<p>Sonoma Cabernets typically show initial blackberry and cassis fruits that evolve into leather, tobacco, and cedar notes around year 8-10. Tannins soften progressively, while integrated oak reveals vanilla and spice complexity. Russian River Pinots develop earthy mushroom and forest floor characteristics, with bright cherry fruit mellowing into deeper, more savory expressions.</p>

<h3>Optimal Storage Conditions</h3>

<p>Maintain consistent <strong>55-58°F temperature</strong> with 60-70% humidity. Store bottles horizontally in vibration-free environments away from light. Sonoma's higher-alcohol wines (14.5%+) benefit from slightly cooler storage to preserve fruit integrity.</p>

<h3>Peak Drinking Windows</h3>

<p>Most Sonoma Chardonnays peak within 3-5 years, while reserving structured Cabernets for 10-15 year windows. Watch for <strong>proper aging signs</strong>: settled sediment, evolved aromatics, and integrated tannins. <strong>Spoilage indicators</strong> include cork taint (wet cardboard smell), excessive browning in young wines, or volatile acidity creating nail polish aromas.</p>

<p class="bg-wine-50 text-wine-700 p-4 rounded">Monitor your Sonoma wines annually after year five, as the region's ripe fruit character can fade faster than cooler-climate equivalents.</p>

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<div class="space-y-6">
  <div>
    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-wine-700 mb-2">What's the difference between Sonoma County and Napa Valley wines?</h3>
    <p class="text-gray-700">Sonoma County wines tend to be more diverse and food-friendly than Napa Valley, with cooler coastal influences creating more elegant, restrained styles. While Napa focuses heavily on Cabernet Sauvignon, Sonoma excels across multiple varietals including Pinot Noir, Chardonnay, and Zinfandel. Sonoma also offers significantly better value, with exceptional wines available at 30-50% less than comparable Napa bottles.</p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-wine-700 mb-2">Which Sonoma wine region is best for beginners?</h3>
    <p class="text-gray-700">Russian River Valley is ideal for wine beginners, producing approachable Pinot Noirs and Chardonnays with bright acidity and food-friendly styles. The region's cooler climate creates wines with lower alcohol and more balanced fruit flavors. Producers like Rochioli, Gary Farrell, and Lynmar Estate offer excellent entry points into premium Sonoma wine without overwhelming tannins or excessive oakiness.</p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-wine-700 mb-2">How long can you age Sonoma Cabernet Sauvignon?</h3>
    <p class="text-gray-700">Premium Sonoma Cabernet Sauvignon from Alexander Valley or Knights Valley can age 15-25 years under proper storage conditions. The key is choosing wines with good tannin structure and acidity from quality producers like Jordan, Silver Oak, or Chateau St. Jean. However, many Sonoma Cabs are made in an approachable style and drink beautifully within 5-8 years of release.</p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibent text-wine-700 mb-2">What's the best value AVA in Sonoma County?</h3>
    <p class="text-gray-700">Dry Creek Valley offers exceptional value, particularly for Zinfandel and Sauvignon Blanc, with many outstanding wines priced between $25-45. The AVA's warm days and cool nights create concentrated flavors without excessive alcohol, and established producers like Quivira, Preston, and Dry Creek Vineyard consistently deliver quality. Alexander Valley also provides excellent value for Cabernet Sauvignon compared to similar wines from Napa.</p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-wine-700 mb-2">Should Sonoma Pinot Noir be served at the same temperature as Burgundy?</h3>
    <p class="text-gray-700">Sonoma Pinot Noir should be served slightly cooler than Burgundy, around 60-62°F compared to 62-65°F for French wines. The riper fruit character and higher alcohol typical in Sonoma Pinots benefit from the cooler serving temperature to maintain freshness and prevent the alcohol from becoming dominant. Russian River Valley and Sonoma Coast Pinots particularly shine when properly chilled.</p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-wine-700 mb-2">What's the biggest mistake people make when buying Sonoma wine?</h3>
    <p class="text-gray-700">The biggest mistake is assuming all Sonoma wines are similar – the county's 18 AVAs have dramatically different microclimates and soil types. A Chardonnay from cool, foggy Sonoma Coast will taste completely different from one made in warm Alexander Valley. Always pay attention to the specific AVA on the label rather than just "Sonoma County" to understand the wine's likely style and character.</p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-wine-700 mb-2">Are there good alternatives to expensive Russian River Pinot Noir?</h3>
    <p class="text-gray-700">Sonoma Coast AVA offers excellent alternatives to pricey Russian River Pinots, often at 20-30% lower prices with similar cool-climate elegance. Producers like Flowers, Hirsch, and Red Car make outstanding coastal Pinots with the same bright acidity and red fruit character. Additionally, Anderson Valley in neighboring Mendocino County provides comparable quality and style at even better value points.</p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-wine-700 mb-2">How do you identify a well-made Sonoma Zinfandel versus an overripe one?</h3>
    <p class="text-gray-700">Well-made Sonoma Zinfandel should have alcohol levels between 14.5-15.5% and show bright red and black fruit flavors with spicy, peppery notes. Overripe versions often exceed 16% alcohol, taste jammy or raisiny, and lack the characteristic brambly spice that defines quality Zin. Look for producers in Dry Creek Valley like Ridge, Ravenswood, or Seghesio who consistently maintain balance and avoid over-extraction.</p>
